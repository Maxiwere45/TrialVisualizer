This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.  ***  *** In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus.  ***  *** Groups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus. ***  *** Rapid progression of inflammation results in a substantial number of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In these most severely ill patients, computed tomography of the chest demonstrates a typical pattern which is suggestive to a degree that it is disease-defining, even if the SARS-COV-2 PCR test is negative.  *** Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema. Single indicator transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) provides bedside measurement of EVLWI. Several studies demonstrated significant and independent association of EVLWI and its changes over time with mortality. A recent study in a non-COVID-19 cohort with ARDS (see ISRCTN32938630) suggests better and earlier prediction of 28-days-mortality compared to traditional scores grading the severity of ARDSARDS. Furthermore, TPTD-monitoring „per se“ was independently associated with a lower mortality.  *** However, pathology of COVID-19 is not fully understood, and there is a lack of data on EVLWI and other TPTD-parameters from COVID-19-patients. *** Therefore, it is the aim of this study to measure EVLWI in patients with COVID-19 and to compare these findings to EVLWI from a recent non-COVID-19 cohort with ARDS. *** As secondary endpoints we will also compare other haemodynamic parameters between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. ***  *** Who can participate? *** Adults with COVID-19 and ARDS according to the Berlin definition ***  *** What does the study involve? *** From the day of intubation, TPTD (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany) will be performed daily to derive EVLWI, Cardiac Index CI and the preload marker global end-diastolic volme index GEDVI. Furthermore, all other parameters derived from the PiCCO-measurement will be documented.  ***  *** What are the possible benefits and risks of participating in the study? *** The possible benefit is a very thorough analysis and monitoring of pulmonary and haemodynamic parameters. There are no additional risks to participants due to the observational design of the study.  ***  *** Where is the study run from? *** General Intensive Care Unit R3a (2/11) of Munich University Hospital (Germany) ***  *** When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? *** March 2020 to April 2020 ***  *** Who is funding the study? *** Technical University of Munich (Germany) ***  *** Who is the main contact? *** Prof. Wolfgang Huber *** Wolfgang.Huber@tum.de",N/A

The investigators will recruit 2800 to 3500 individuals, divided into two groups: Group one (N= 2300): This will include all age groups (0-24years), with recruitment restricted by postcodes provided by Public Health England (PHE) to recruit a representative population for the region as assessed by the IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores). Group two (N= up to 1200): This group has been added following additional funding to enhance the sample size in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will recruit 0-19 year olds and will not be restricted by post code sampling. Instead recruitment will be by public promotion within the normal recruiting regions for each site. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Public Health England has an ongoing sero-prevalence programme to assess how well the population is protected from vaccine preventable diseases. The current way to check this is by testing left over blood samples from participating healthcare laboratories around the country. However, these samples may not be representative of the general population, particularly in younger age groups who are often most at risk from vaccine preventable diseases. In the Netherlands, they use a different system to assess how well the population is protected from vaccine preventable diseases, actively collecting blood samples from a representative cross section of society. This type of approach would address the limitations of using residual serum samples and allows the collection of additional relevant history e.g. number of family members and previous vaccines received. The investigators are therefore proposing a pilot study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national sero- epidemiological survey in England in individuals aged 0 - 24 years. The investigators will be focusing initially on diphtheria and group C invasive meningococcal disease, both of which are vaccine preventable. This will involve enrolling 2300 participants in the study from different geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds across our test sites and taking a blood sample. This blood will be analysed to look at the level of immunity to vaccine preventable diseases. The original protocol has been amended to include the testing of antibodies against other infectious diseases, specifically COVID-19. A second group has been added to recruit an additional 500 to 1200 participants between the ages of 0-19 years. The additional funding has been used to open two more sites to recruit to group two across regions on England that are currently not represented by this study. Having a large number of blood samples from a range of age groups is useful when gathering information about an emerging disease such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19). These samples can help provide answers regarding the true number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19 disease) in this population. In addition to increasing the sample size and the number of regions in the UK that are being sampled, a longitudinal sampling cohort has been introduced. Approximately 20% of participants equally distributed over the age bands will be enrolled into the longitudinal aspect of the study where repeat blood and saliva samples are taken to look for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A questionnaire to ascertain whether the participant or any household contacts have had any symptoms of or been tested positive for COVID-19 will also be collected.",N/A

The first reports of COVID-19 came from Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly around the globe, accounting for thousands of deaths in multiple countries. On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 manifests primarily as a respiratory illness, several cardiovascular implications have been reported related to its natural course and treatment. Its exact effect on the cardiovascular system though is currently unknown. Therefore, we propose a retrospective, observational, case-control study looking for cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including laboratory evidence of myocardial injury, electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmias and echocardiographic abnormalities. Hospitalized patients admitted with fever, cough, sore throat, and/or dyspnea who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be included in our study and will be matched based on their age and gender with patients admitted with similar symptoms who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The electronic medical charts of the study subjects will be reviewed and relevant demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be deidentified and recorded. Since our study will be a retrospective chart review study it carries minimal risk for the patients and the investigators. Cardiovascular disease associated with COVID-19 might be contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This will be the first, large, case-control study assessing cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 in a well-defined cohort of patients. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Significance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading infection that has already affected close to a million patients around the world. It is estimated that COVID-19 will be lethal for up to 200,000 Americans. Several cardiovascular manifestations have been reported to be associated with the disease or its treatment and might be contributing to its high mortality rates.1,2 The National Health Commission of China (NHC) documented that approximately 12% of patients without prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) who expired in the setting of COVID-19 had either elevated cardiac troponin I levels or a cardiac arrest during hospitalization.3 Furthermore, patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities experience worse outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2.1 Acute myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, and heart failure have been associated with COVID-19.3 However, most of these associations come from small observational studies or from comparisons with other coronaviruses.3 The hypothesized pathogenetic mechanism of CVD in COVID-19 includes either direct effects of the virus to the cardiac cells expressing the angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, or indirect effects from the severe systemic inflammatory response, cytokine surge and immune system activation. The exact effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system though is still not well known. This study seeks to identify the prevalence of CVD and its role in clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a large tertiary center of Houston, TX. CVD associated with COVID-19 might be contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This will be the first, large, case-control study assessing cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 in a well-defined cohort of patients. Methods: Study population and data handling: A retrospective observational case-control study will be performed. Multiple hospitals will participate in the current study and the study protocol will be submitted separately to each local IRB for approval. Subjects admitted to the participating hospitals from March 30th, 2020 to March 30th, 2021, who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR will be identified through the microbiology lab registry. Subjects who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR will be age- and gender-matched with subjects admitted to the hospital with similar symptoms but negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 (one negative PCR test for patients of low clinical suspicion and two negative tests, 24 hours apart from each other, for patients of high clinical suspicion). Demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be collected by retrospective electronic chart review. The current study will not involve face-to-face patient contact and does not intent to alter the usual care of the patients involved. The collected data will be deidentified and stored in a HIPAA approved, password-secured designated folder of the UTH-share drive of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. No patient information will be stored or processed in any personal electronic devices. A total of 500 study subjects are estimated to be included in the study. Upon completion of the study, the data will be stored for an additional 5 years; following that all research-related files will be permanently deleted. Data collection: Demographic characteristics including age at the time of diagnosis, gender, race and body mass index will be collected. Past medical history including coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking status as well as home medications will be abstracted. The name and daily dose of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers will be recorded. Laboratory values including cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, hemoglobin and creatinine will be collected. Available electrocardiograms (EKGs) and transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) will be individually reviewed by an independent cardiovascular disease fellow or a cardiovascular disease faculty member who will be blinded to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. Finally, clinical outcomes including need for mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospitalization, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality will be abstracted from the electronic charts. Statistical analysis: Continuous variables will be tested for distribution. Normally distributed variables will be presented as mean values +/- standard deviation (SD) and compared using the student's t test. Non-normally distributed variables will be presented as median values with interquartile ranges and compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables will be presented as percentages and compared using chi-square test. Multivariable regression analysis will be performed to control for possible cofounder. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed using STATA 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).",N/A

The aim of this study is to follow a cohort of healthy children over six months and measure their antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-stranded RNA viruses with a roughly 30 kb genome. The majority of coronaviruses cause disease in a specific host species but some have infected humans by cross-species transmission. This process has led to a number of severe outbreaks of human disease including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. From December 2019 a novel infection ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Wuhan region of China. The infection was identified as the causal factor in a growing number of severe cases of pneumonia. This disease was subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organisation (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause severe disease similar to the previous SARS coronavirus from 2003. Severe disease is associated with pneumonia and damage to vital organs including lung, heart, liver, and kidney. Fortunately SARS-CoV-2 appears to cause only mild, or no, symptoms in children. The social distancing measures in the United Kingdom include the closure of schools and the cancelling of routine paediatric clinics. These drastic, but necessary, steps are likely to have a profound effect on the well-being of children. This study is required to determine what proportion of children have been exposed to SARS-Cov-2 and how many, if any, have neutralizing antibodies. The findings from this study could be used to inform public health decisions regarding the re-opening of schools and other services vital to the well-being of children.",N/A

Since then, the outbreak has spread to 5 continents, affecting 185 countries or regions, with more than 2,500,000 confirmed cases as of April 21, 2020. Ecuador, the 9th country according to territorial extension, and the 7th according to the number of inhabitants in South America, is the 4th country with the highest number of cases in that region of the world, only behind Brazil, Peru and Chile. According to data from the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) of Ecuador, as of April 20, 2020, the National Institute for Public Health Research (INSPI) has registered 33,279 samples, of which 10,128 are positive for SARS-CoV-2. By far, the province of Guayas where Guayaquil is located, the main city in terms of number of inhabitants of the country, is the region with the highest number of affected, with 6921 confirmed cases and 6274 with suspicion. Given the importance of this infection, the severity in some cases, its rapid distribution, and the differences in the Ecuadorian population with respect to the other countries where infected patients have been reported, the investigators consider that an updated analysis of cases, taking as a reference, patients seen in various hospitals of the city of Guayaquil can help identify the clinical characteristics and severity of the disease. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Design: Retrospective cohort study that will review the data of patients seen in participating centers with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19 between March and April 2020.

A patient with a severe acute respiratory infection (with fever and who needs to be hospitalized), and without another etiology that fully explains the clinical manifestations, and who has traveled to or resided in China in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, or a patient with any acute respiratory illness and in whom at least one of the following conditions is met in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms: having contact with a confirmed or probable case of infection with the COVID-19 virus, or having worked or been in a health care facility where patients with confirmed or probable infection with the COVID-19 virus were being treated, according to WHO criteria. Cases with nasopharyngeal exudate for SARS-CoV-2 negative are excluded from the study. Ambit: Emergency, hospitalization and intensive care services at participating centers. Subjects to study: Patients older than 18 years with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 that required admission at participating centers. Study variables: - Demographic variables: Age, Sex, Personal history (hypertension, diabetes, previous cardiovascular disease, previous chronic lung disease, active smoking, obesity, etc.). - Clinical variables: previous contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient, days of onset of symptoms until the first consultation, symptoms (fever, asthenia / deterioration of general condition, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, ageusia, diarrhea, nausea, headache), signs present in the first recorded physical examination (blood pressure, saturation, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, auscultation, edema, weight and height). - Laboratory variables: blood count, C-reactive protein (PCR), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, Ferritin, AST, ALT, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase, coagulation times, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium . Arterial blood gas when available. - Radiological variables: findings on plain radiography and chest computed tomography (CT). - Microbiological variables: nasopharyngeal exudate for SARS-CoV-2, sputum culture, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood cultures, urine culture. - Prognostic variables: need for hospitalization, length of hospital stay, need for admission to the Intensive Surveillance Unit (LVU), length of stay at LVU, need for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), development of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, severity of pneumonia (CURB-65), sepsis (qSOFA), renal failure, electrolytic disturbances, stroke, ischemic heart disease, pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and death. - Therapeutic variables: treatment administered (Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, Azithromycin, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Oseltamivir, Tocilizumab, Corticosteroids, Ivermectin, Nitaxozanide, Enoxaparin or other low molecular weight heparin), dose administered, drug combination, time of administration, (counting the days from the onset of symptoms), registered adverse effects. Definitions: Fever is defined as axillary temperature greater than 37.5ºC. Lymphopenia is defined as the presence of <1500 cells / mm3. Thrombocytopenia is defined as the presence of <150,000 platelets / mm3. ARDS will be defined according to the Berlin criteria, CID according to the ISTH criteria, Pneumonia will be defined according to SEPAR criteria and its severity will be based on the CURB-65 scale. The rest of the variables that require a definition will be defined according to standard clinical practice. Statistic analysis: The data will be collected in a Microsoft Excel database, and will be exported to the SPSS statistical package for mathematical analysis. The mean and standard deviation (SD) will be used as measures of centralization and dispersion, respectively, in the case of quantitative variables with normal distribution. In case of variables that do not present normal distribution, the median and the interquartile range (RIQ) will be used. The study of the normality of the distributions will be carried out using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Qualitative variables will be expressed as percentages. -Inferential: The independent means will be compared using the Student's t test for variables that follow a normal distribution, otherwise the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. The Wilcoxon test will be used for paired data. The association between qualitative variables will be evaluated by means of the Chi square test (χ2) (or Fisher's test, if applicable). In the hypothesis test it will require an error α less than 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis. Ethical aspects: In the process and development of the present study, patients will not be contacted and only the information collected in the medical records will be accessed. These medical records will be used solely and exclusively for the purposes of the study. The study presented here will follow the standards of Good Clinical Practice, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Seoul 2013), and the Oviedo Convention (1997). No identifying or clinical data of the patients will be provided and the investigators will work on an anonymized and password protected file that does not allow traceability of the people included in the registry. Likewise, the handling of data will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Law on data protection and the Law on the rights and protection of the patient. Informed consent: The investigators will request exemption from informed consent as it is considered disproportionate measures to call or make appointments for each of the patients or their families, taking into account that this is a retrospective study based on the review of medical records. The database will be anonymized in compliance with current legal regulations.",N/A

Additionally, in the event many people become critically ill at once, COVID-19 has the possibility of overwhelming hospitals to the point where they have to make decisions about how to determine who receives intensive care and life-support measures. Many hospitals as well as local or state governments have been working on policies to determine how to make these decisions. This study seeks to learn about how COVID-19 has affected the way patients and healthcare providers care for themselves and about their thoughts and concerns about policies that may ""ration"" life-support resources. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background: COVID-19 has led to significant disruptions to usual operations of the health care system and routines of millions of people. Regular medical appointments have been preempted or converted to telemedicine, dietary changes have occurred due to food supply chain strain, and exercise regimens altered by physical distancing policies, all of which may affect preventive care and chronic illness management. Additionally, anxiety about risk of developing COVID-19 and the availability of health care resources may alter care-seeking behaviors even for serious conditions, e.g., heart attacks. Understanding personal health and protective behaviors under threat of COVID-19 is an epidemiologic imperative and can inform immediate public health response as well as planning for population health needs post-crisis. Critical care capacity during COVID-19 is also a matter of extreme concern. Limitations in capacity, particularly mechanical ventilators have necessitated scarce resource allocation (SRA) policies, which outline triage protocols while observing ethical principles of distributive justice, transparency, and equitability. In practice, these policies determine which patients are most likely to benefit from intensive care, and some patients with a significantly heightened risk for mortality are less likely to be prioritized in critical care allocation decisions. The uncertainty around prioritization and threat of rationing of care has generated public attention and anxiety evident in medical journals, news outlets, and on social media. The rapidity of this crisis has compelled rapid development and/or modification of SRA policies without the rigorous stakeholder engagement or evaluations of acceptance of these policies by both laypersons and practitioners tasked with implementing such policies. Two states (CA & NY), among the most affected by COVID-19, have recently developed new SRA policies, creating a unique opportunity to evaluate how these policies are understood and perceived by the patients most likely to be impacted by them and the practitioners who will implement them. Moreover, given the complexity of the ethical underpinnings and potential misinformation about SRA policies, there is a clear need to determine if a brief educational intervention can influence perception and knowledge about these containment and management policies. The investigators propose to undertake rapid recruitment of a national cohort of individuals and health care workers to understand knowledge and perceptions of public health and clinical efforts during this evolving pandemic; and to implement a randomized controlled trial within this cohort to test the ability of a brief intervention to improve knowledge and perceptions about the health care system's capacity to provide equitable care during a pandemic. The specific aims are to: - Aim 1: Determine how key indicators of population health (including health status, health behaviors, and access to care) have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. - Aim 1a: Uncover the extent of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 on health, health behaviors, and access to care. - Aim 2: Assess the public's and practitioners' knowledge and values around SRA policies and examine which individual characteristics correlate with these knowledge and values. - Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of a brief educational intervention on knowledge and values for SRA policy among the public and health care workers. Population & Recruitment: For Aim 1, the investigators will employ national outreach strategies via social media and partnerships with national organizations to recruit a sample of adults (ages 18 and older) from the general population. The investigators will enrich this sample by direct recruitment efforts (via online health portal invitation) of over 300,000 patients in the Southern California Area who are cared for in the University of California at Los Angeles Health System (UCLA Health). For Aim 2, the investigators will employ similar national outreach strategies involving professional language targeted posts on social media sites (e.g., Doximity, LinkedIn) to recruit a sample of health care providers. Additionally, this cohort will be enriched by direct recruitment efforts of health workers employed by UCLA. Cohort participants in Aims 1 & 2 from California and New York (residence determined based on ZIP code) will be randomized for Aim 3 to receive either a brief educational video or no intervention. All participants (Aims 1-3) will be invited to complete three surveys (baseline, one-month post-intervention follow-up, and four-month follow-up; Figure 1). Sample recruitment path and representativeness with be assessed using unique source links and standard visitor tracking analytics built into the study website. Survey Assessments: Participants will first be presented with an online consent form that includes language typical of a written consent and upon affirming consent will be directed to complete the baseline survey. The patient baseline survey will collect sociodemographic information (including ZIP code), chronic conditions and current health status, health behaviors, anxiety and stress levels, changes to health and care seeking behaviors (e.g., social distancing, medication adherence, care-seeking behaviors), and will include series of questions assessing perceptions and attitudes and knowledge about SRA policies and how they are implemented (e.g., values about how decisions are made, understanding of prioritization versus exclusion from critical care). Demographic, behavioral, and access questions are largely derived from the validated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires which will provide a historical comparison for study results. For providers, additional questions about the characteristics of the provider will include specialty, years of practice, and trainee status. Follow-up surveys will re-administer key baseline questions on SRA knowledge and values, personal health behaviors, and COVID-19-specific impacts (e.g., if they or a loved one was hospitalized and/or was subject to an SRA policy decision, and for providers, whether they had to use an SRA tool during their practice); follow-up surveys will additional ascertain exposure to media coverage about COVID-19 and SRAs in the intervening windows. All surveys will be administered via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system and links to complete follow-up surveys will be automatically delivered to participants via e-mail, with up to four reminders to complete, facilitating linkage between survey administration within individuals. E-mails will be stored separately from survey data in REDCap and will be permanently deleted upon study completion. Intervention and Randomization: The investigators will develop a brief (~3 min) video intervention that describes what SRA policies are, how they were developed, who is most likely to be impacted, and patients' rights under these policies. Two versions will be utilized, one oriented for a lay audience and one for practitioners using technical medical language, but both will be relevant to the policies currently in place in two of the hardest hit states (NY and CA). The investigators have contracted with WorldWise Productions, who have completed similar videos for multiple other UCLA Health and DGSOM projects. The intervention will be hosted on a private YouTube channel and embedded in REDCap so that it can be automatically delivered as part of the survey. The investigators will execute a stratified randomization scheme based on state, age, and education level to allocate respondents from CA and NY evenly between intervention and control. Participants outside CA & NY will serve as negative controls. All participants will receive a post-intervention survey with repeat assessment (as described above). Focus Groups: Because COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving crisis and there are no pre-existing validated questions to ascertain COVID-19 perceptions and impacts, the investigators plan to conduct a final qualitative follow-up (post-crisis) with a geographically and sociodemographically diverse selection of participants (both patients and providers) in order to obtain a more nuanced and complete examination of perceptions, attitudes, and experiences. Participants selected will be invited to participate approximately 4-6 months later (after the COVID-19 crisis has slowed). Key health behavior themes will include experience with telemedicine, disruptions to health care access, and general changes to health during and after COVID-19 pandemic; particular attention will be paid to inequities in these outcomes. Key SRA themes will include the method of selecting patients, concerns about equity, special considerations for disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, and perceptions of the crisis response in general. Groups will be conducted via web-conference using Zoom and recorded, transcribed, and then qualitative methods used to analyze transcripts for key themes. The investigators plan to conduct approximately 15 focus groups of 5-10 participants each. Power: To detect a ½ standard deviation change in the number of correct knowledge items between the intervention and control arms with 90% power and a two-sided α=0.05, 172 total participants are needed to complete follow-up. Based on prior work with >80% trial retention and recruitment of 55 participants per day, the investigators anticipate recruiting the necessary 216 baseline trial participants within 4 days. The investigators anticipate that they will substantially exceed the targets to achieve desired trial power. Milestones & Actionable Outcomes: There is a paucity of evidence on changes in health status and behaviors related to physical distancing policies and the widescale adoption and implementation of SRA policies. By determining how health behaviors and access to care are impacted at baseline, the investigators can directly issue recommendations for patients and providers aimed at affecting population health and mitigating disparities therein. The assessment of SRA policies and how they are perceived and implemented during a crisis will dramatically increase the ability to design and apply such policies in a fair and equitable way and to determine what adjustments to the policies from a clinical perspective are needed to ensure that disproportionate burden is not borne by vulnerable patients. As the baseline survey has already been developed, piloted, and programmed into REDCap and the investigators have established partnerships with several organizations who have already agreed to assist with study recruitment - the investigators are prepared to initiate the study immediately. Production on the intervention video can begin as soon as notice of funds have been received. Trial milestones include recruitment of >216 participants from CA & NY within the first week of recruitment and retention of >172 participants at one-month follow-up. Additional milestones include the submission of several research papers to high-impact medical journals detailing research findings.",N/A

Effective of the study: All consecutive patients included in the study whose data are collected e-CRF until 31/12/2020. ***  *** Detailed Description *** 1. Background and objectives: Coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), linked to the SARS-Cov-2 virus, is rapidly spreading worldwide. After the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei, European healthcare systems are facing an outbreak of seriously ill patients, but few are fully equipped to manage this health crisis. On the occasion of this pandemic, the hepatologist associations of United States , Europe and France as well as the French Federation of Digestive Cancer have proposed modalities for the management of patients with chronic liver disease likely to guarantee them maximum safety. The level of scientific evidence for these proposals is very low, given the small amount of objective clinical data available to date on the relationship between COVID-19 and liver. Some preliminary Chinese data indicates that: - 2-11% of patients treated for COVID19 had underlying chronic liver disease - an increase in transaminases is observed in 25-35% of patients, generally moderate (median 23-39 IU/L), with a higher rate in symptomatic and/or severe forms and/or requiring hospitalization in intensive care unit as well as in patients who later die . The mechanism involved is uncertain to date. Indeed, the data suggesting the possibility of localization of the virus in the liver are too preliminary, and it is reasonable to incriminate the elements of inflammatory reaction syndrome. Liver damage can be explained during these infections by hepatic hypoxia, related to a frequent viral myocarditis in this situation. Finally, other more classic causes may also be associated, including drug (paracetamol, antibiotics), or an exacerbation of an underlying chronic liver disease, known or unknown. Control of viral serologies B and C is therefore recommended in this situation. - elderly patients, patients with cirrhosis, patients with immune hepatitis under immunosuppressive drugs and patients before and after transplantation under immunosuppressive therapy would be the subjects most at risk of severe COVID19 - very strict preventive measures have proven their effectiveness in terms of mortality in 111 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, including 2/3 hospitalized and 1/3 ambulatory. In this totally new and unexpected context, the board meeting of the AFEF proposes the national observatory COVID19-FOIE, intended to collect data of patients with liver disease (all stages combined) or liver transplants that developed COVID19 confirmed by PCR on nasopharyngeal sampling and/or thoracic CT. 2. Population: All patients with acute or chronic liver disease treated by a member of the AFEF with an established diagnosis of COVID 19 confirmed by PCR on nasopharyngeal and/or thoracic CT. 3. Methodology: This is an epidemiological, observational, prospective, descriptive, prognostic and evaluative observational cohort study. This study does not change the patient's management; it consists of analyzing clinical-biological data collected as part of the patient's usual follow-up. 4. Objectives: Primary Objective: Evaluate the mortality related to Covid-19 in patients with a chronic liver disease Secondary objectives: - Evaluate the mortality (liver-related and no liver-related) due to the Covid-19 according to the cirrhotic status, an history of hepatocellular carcinoma, an immunosuppressive treatment and this type, the etiology-ies of liver disease at the infection (viral hepatitis -B and/or C-, related to alcohol consumption, metabolic syndrome, hemochromatosis, immune liver disease, other or unknown), and comorbidities - Evaluate the liver morbidity related to Covid-19, including : - incidence of liver biochemical abnormalities in patients with normal liver enzymes values or of a 2-fold increase of usual values for AST, ALT, GGT, alcalines phosphatasis - incidence of liver complications (acute hepatitis, liver insufficiency, decompensation of cirrhosis, encephalopathy, renal insufficiency) 5.

According to the present knowledge the COVID-19, also known as novel type Coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2), belongs to a large family of viruses consist-ing of hundreds of variations and subtypes of this virus (World Health Organisation (WHO)/emergencies, April 2nd 2020). These types of virus' can cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms ranging from a mild cold to pneumonia. The clinical manifestation of this novel type of Coronavirus - COVID-19 - was found to cause more severe pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). According to the data of Arabi and colleagues (2020) average age in Chinese affected individuals were 60, 40% had comorbid conditions, 42% required invasive mechanical ventilation and the mortality rate was at 62%. Epidemiological information from other countries is not yet published. According to the WHO in the Europe Region, 503730 cases and 33617 deaths were reported since January 25th 2020. In the 8,5 million populated countries of Switzerland, the number of confirmed cases raised to 23'574 and 756 deaths (Bundesamt für Gesundheit) Situationsbericht, April 9th). According to this report, the incidence of infection and hospitalization is highest in individuals aged 50 and older with a higher presence registered in men. Nevertheless, a certain number of affected individuals is between 20 and 50 years which is in accordance with the number presented from large studies in China (50.7%-55.1%). Among the 23'674 positive tested 2730 are currently hospitalized. Among these 280 individuals require mechanically assisted ventilation, meaning health care at an intensive care unit (status April 2nd). In this acute situation of the pandemic, there is an enormous urge to finding a vaccine or medications to release or prevent severe symptoms and complications due to the new virus. Therefore, in the listed studies keen interest is on drug interventions to stop the expansion of this virus. However, knowledge on long-term consequences of physical condition and psychological state is unknown. Although, taking into account the clinical manifestation observed in the severe cases negative long-term consequences have to be expected as described in the following paragraph. Up to date knowledge exist on the clinical manifestation which varies from asymptomatic to severe disease with approximately 80% of the cases found to present an asymptomatic carrier. Thus, about 13.8% to 35% is suffering a severe course including dyspnoea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, desaturation of blood oxygen (≤93%) and or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung within 24-48 hours. Further signs of hospitalized individuals are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and sputum production. In literature, the clinical picture is described as bilateral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome which leads to a severe organ failure of the lung. These patients require oxygen therapy with invasive (17%) or non-invasive (14%) mechanically assisted ventilation. And the higher probability of preloaded organ dysfunctions due to co-morbidities most often high blood pressure (13%), diabetes (4-6%) and COPD (1-5%) has to be taken into account. According to the WHO report and Lai et al (2020) between 6.1% to 28%, respectively, were found to be in a critical stage. Acute respiratory failure, septic shock and/ or multiple organ failure defined this stage. According to a retrospective analysis from a large population in Wuhan, these patients require intensive care with most of them presenting (multi) organ failure with acute respiratory distress (ARDS, 67%), acute kidney injury (29%), cardiac injury (23%), and liver dysfunction (29%). These patients require invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate for critically ill COVID-19 patients varies from 1-4% to 4.3% according to large studies reported by Lai et al. (2020). According to these statistics, about 4.3% of the 280 patients requiring intensive care in Switzerland (n=12) would not survive. Taking the current number of 2730 hospitalised patients reported above, these statistics result in about 2718 individuals surviving severe illness in Switzerland. A critical point is the high risk of the length of stay on the ward as explained in the following paragraph. Patients in the severe and critical state are likely to suffer prolonged length of stay in the hospital according to Lia et al. (2020) and Wang et al. (2020) (±21 days). Studies on ARDS and critically ill patients led to strong evidence that prolonged length of stay, particularly with prolonged mechanical ventilation, leads to a significant negative impact on lung function, physical activity and emotional state. For example, from 109 patients suffered an ARDS (age interquartile from 35 to 57) the 5 years follow up showed a relevant reduction on physical condition (76% of the distance in the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)) when compared to age and sex-matched norm values. Interestingly, these deficits were found despite normal to ""near""-normal pulmonary function. A recent post-hoc analysis on 116 patients mechanically ventilated for at least >24h showed that a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and exposure to norepinephrine were associated with intensive-care-unit acquired weakness (ICU-AW; defined as <48/100 on the Medical Research Council Score). Hatch et al. (2018) for example found in their multicenter follow-up study, that 46% of the survivors of critical illness suffered from anxiety, 40% from depression and 22% from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the specific population of ARDS survivors (n=74) numbers are slightly lower ranging from moderate to severe depression in 16% and 23%, respectively and for anxiety 24% and 23% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. These findings on survivors of ARDS and critical illness underline the assumption that survivors of a COVID-19 induced hospitalized will suffer from physical and psychological long-term consequences. In research on critical illness post-ICU, only moderate evidence and large risk of bias exist on the effect of follow-up rehabilitation post-ICU. However, some qualitative studies support the thought that patients might need additional care after discharge home. King et al. (2019) investigated in their scoping review of qualitative studies the needs of critical illness survivors and found that after discharge home patients had continuing information needs on understanding their critical illness and coping with the long-term sequelae and stress. These qualitative findings were underlined and supported by quantitative studies investigating long-term effects in this population. In patients who suffered an acute respiratory failure greatest change in physical function was found two months after discharge. And in ICU survivors requiring one or more weeks of mechanical ventilation the degree of disability one week after ICU discharge was predictive for physical and mental recovery and mortality in the one-year follow up. In contrast to the findings on critical illness aftercare programs were found having a positive impact in a population with pulmonary disease. In survivors of ARDS due to severe influenza, A pneumonitis an 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation program improved significantly exercise capacity and quality of life improved significantly. And in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the American Thoracic Society recommends respiratory rehabilitation early after discharge. Furthermore, according to the NICE guidelines ""Rehabilitation after critical illness in adults"" patients with rehabilitation needs should be seen two to three months after hospital discharge and should be reassessed to establish health and social care needs. Additionally, based on an expert consensus following questions are still unanswered and considered as being relevant for the rehabilitation of these patients. Some examples are listed below: - ""What proportion of COVID-19 survivors have (extra-pulmonary) physical, functional, emotional and sociable treatable traits, justifying rehabilitation…?"" - ""What types of patients will exist post-COVID-19 (e.g. good recovery, frailty, persistent respiratory impairment) and in what proportion?"" - ""What is the impact of a COVID-19-related prolonged ward stay on physical and emotional functioning? - What are the opportunities to intervene early, immediately post-acute hospital discharge? - For how long after hospital discharge are COVID-19 survivors contagious? The latter two questions are cardinal to provide safe and feasible rehabilitation post-acute hospital discharge. To present the feasibility and safety of the aftercare program developed and conducted on the study site a short excurse on literature is provided. Recent knowledge (published February 28 and 1st of April) from high impact journals give following solid time frames on viral shedding according to the traceability of Covid-19 RNA. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of virus RNA was used to measure the quantity of virus RNA in both studies. Wölfel and colleagues isolated the virus daily from sputum, pharyngeal swabs, and stool since the first day of symptom onset. The samples were taken from individuals with mild to moderate symptoms (e.g. symptoms of lung affection). Maximal viral load was found before 5 days in these participants with the mild course being highest in stool and sputum. Based on their findings authors state that being 10 days beyond symptoms and less than 100,000 viral RNA copies per ml of sputum do have a little residual risk of infectivity, based on cell culture. Ling et al., isolated viral RNA from 66 participants post-Covid-19 infection as well from the stool, urine, and blood specimens during the convalescence. These samples were obtained from patients who survived a severe course of infection. The longest duration from onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs of convalescent patients was 22 days. Zhou et al. (2020) studied as well the viral shedding with the daily analysis using PCR of Covid-19 throat swab specimens from 191 patients. For survivors, the duration of viral shedding showed an interquartile range of 17 to 22 days in patients with severe disease status (survivors). In summary, current knowledge shows the duration of viral traceability and thus the risk of infection from 10 to 22 days in patients with mild and severe illness, respectively. The average time to incubation found ranged from 5.2 to 12.5 days (Zhou et al., 2020) and average hospital duration ranged from 7 to 15 days in the 425 patients from Wuhan. Therefore, subtracting lowest period of incubation (5 days) from the maximal duration of viral shedding (22 days) resulting in 17 days after first confirmed diagnose to be safe for hospital on-site testing. Based on this data and adding the criteria 4 days without specific COVID-19 symptoms (described in chapter 6.2.1), the committee developing the specific aftercare program - from which data will be taken for this study - considered as safe and feasible inviting patients post-acute hospital discharge when 14 days post diagnose and the mentioned four days (total ≥18 days). In summary, there is a lack of knowledge on long term consequences of physical, emotional and quality of life outcomes. The similarity of clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 infection with ARDS or/and critical illness leads to the consideration of evidence found in this patient population. This evidence points out the high risk of long-term deficits on the above-mentioned outcomes and the relevance of patient-tailored rehabilitation programs. Therefore, we consider it as essential to gather and analyse data on short and long-term quality of life and physical performance of patients after hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection.",N/A

SF12, EQ-5D-5L and work status standardized quantitative assessments of quality of life will be implemented via telephone follow-up at these time-points. Previous studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 at PWH showed that significant numbers of recovering patients had impaired long-term health status. It is important to see if these same problems also afflict patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the novel coronavirus which causes COVID-19). ***  *** Detailed Description *** Nearly two million cases have been documented, and thousands have died of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hong Kong has seen nearly 1,000 documented cases of COVID-19 as of April 11, 2020. Potentially many more cases have gone unreported. The virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV2, is a coronavirus, from the same group of viruses as the SARS virus from 2003. Worldwide, COVID-19 has killed many more patients than SARS, yet the two viruses share a similar background. As the peak of viral infections begins to recede, however, the main priority will shift to the process of recovery. Over the past 17 years, Professor David SC HUI has published multiple follow-up examinations of SARS patients conducted at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) outpatient clinics. He found that SARS patients suffered serious long-term effects after ostensibly recovering from their illnesses. Moreover, healthcare workers, who were disproportionately affected by SARS infections in 2003 were also disproportionately affected by long-term disability. Like SARS, many COVID-19 patients require intensive care, intubation, and aggressive medical therapy. One of the treatments tried for SARS patients was high-dose corticosteroids, which has been associated with avascular necrosis of major joints and long term disability. As the COVID-19 pandemic only started a few months ago, it is still unknown if COVID-19 patients will suffer the same fate as SARS survivors. Recent COVID-19 research has logically focused on the acute diagnosis and treatment of affected patients in order to avoid short -term morbidity and mortality. Past research looking at SARS outcomes showed that both the six month exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors was lower than that of normal controls. Sepsis patients also experience serious disease caused by infection, and long-term reductions in quality of life have been described in survivors of sepsis. Patients who survive intensive care go on to show deficits in verbal learning and memory, resulting in limitations in returning to work or school. Many SARS survivors developed post-traumatic stress disorder and other debilitating psychological illnesses. Based on the Hong Kong experience with SARS, the investigators are concerned that COVID-19 survivors are at risk for similar challenges in quality of life after discharge from acute care. The Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit of the Chinese University of Hong Kong based at PWH has worked on multiple studies involving quality of life. In particular, the investigators have previously collaborated with Professor Hui and the CUHK Department of Medicine and Therapeutics (M&T) on a quality of life follow-up study on SARS patients. As for studying health related quality of life, the investigators currently have an ongoing project examining the subject in trauma patients after discharge. Several instruments have been widely used in quality of life research, including the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instruments (WHOQOL-BREF), EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D-5L) and the Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D). Our team has experience using the SF-36, SF-12v2(HK) and the EQ-5D-5L survey instruments for monitoring quality of life in research subjects in Hong Kong. For example, the investigators found that trauma patients in Hong Kong scored significantly worse on the SF-36 twelve months after injury. The investigators also found the most dramatic improvements happened in the first one to six months post-injury, and that 45% of subjects had achieved an excellent outcome by four years post-injury. The SF-12v2(HK) with four week recall is a modified version of the SF-36 to be shorter and quicker to use, while also already translated and validated in Hong Kong. The investigators aim to combine our experience with conducting quantitative quality of life studies with the CUHK Department of M&T's expertise in coronavirus treatment and followup to explore the quality of life of COVID-19 patients in recovery. The reported mortality rates for COVID-19 has so far been lower than SARS, although the higher absolute numbers of COVID-19 patients mean worldwide deaths are overall much higher. Trauma, sepsis and SARS survivors have all experienced significant long-term morbidity and decreased quality of life as a result of their injuries or infections. A previous study of patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 at PWH showed that significant numbers of recovering patients had impaired long-term health status. The question this study hopes to answer is to what degree do COVID-19 patients suffer a similar fate? Has the knowledge gained from the SARS experience led to improved quality of life outcomes compared to SARS survivors? Or do the similarities between the viruses that cause SARS and COVID-19 extend to a reduced quality of life after recovery as well?",N/A

The psychological effects of the illness itself and the traumatic experiences of loved ones are experienced by individuals and complete health systems. Added to this, the social ecosystem and family finances are also severely affected. After several months of the outbreak start and several weeks of quarantine and self-isolation, the emotional burden on the community has increased. Added to this, many of the confirmed cases are healthcare workers. In addition to the risk of infection, these front-line staff are exposed to high levels of stress and anxiety. This gets worse as the pressure on the health system increases, forcing them to deal with significant ethical issues. To respond to all these issues, the research group led by Dr. Cris Vilaplana at the Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), have launched a questionnaire to ask the public, including health professionals, how are they being affected by the pandemic, not only in relation to their health but in terms of their emotional wellbeing and their family finances. The project is an initiative of the SMA-TB consortium (IGTP and Anaxomics) to fight against COVID-19. The Fundació Lluita contra la SIDA is also collaborating in the project. The survey is based on questions related to depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder, which have already been used in other epidemic outbreaks and in disaster situations, but it also includes questions adapted to the current situation. The survey (now available in 4 languages) has been designed to be shared using a snowball strategy, making possible for everybody to participate and collaborate. The results obtained will initially help us to better understand the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the general wellbeing of the population and health workers so that we can go on to develop strategies in coordination those in charge of administrations in order to adapt policies to people's real needs. The results of the study will be published in a scientific article and will be publicly available. ***  *** Detailed Description *** In March 30, 2020, 78797 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, 6528 deaths and 14709 recovered were reported in Spain[1]; 16157 cases and 1410 deaths recorded in Catalonia[2]. Case fatality (8%) is calculated on the registered cases, even if the actual mortality rate is uncertain as the total number of cases (including those undiagnosed and with mild symptoms) is unknown [3]. It is already a fact that there is local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Everyone with a compatible respiratory condition is considered likely to be a case of SARS-CoV-2[4], despite that the etiological diagnosis cannot be made in this context of health emergency for all cases suspected, because of the lack of kits, personnel and saturation of the health system. Other major outbreaks of infectious diseases as Ebola have demonstrated that there is an important impact on the individuals and the communities. Psychological effects of the disease itself as well as the traumatic experience on the beloved ones are seen at individual level. At community level, health services, social system and economic productivity are severely affected[5]. After 2 months weeks of first case reported in Spain and 2,5 weeks of the quarantine and self-isolation of the region of Catalonia, the emotional burden of the general community has increased. In previous studies in other countries in which the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have precede ours, a non despicable impact on mental health and emotional burden has been reported as well as has been demonstrated in mass quarantines which have been implemented in other epidemics context [6-8]. Moreover, a certain level of anxiety has been reported as necessary to adopt recommended precautionary measures against infection outbreaks[9], and therefore to successfully implement public health interventions understanding the attitudes and measuring psychological impact on people should be mandatory. On the other hand, in our setting by last report at 30th March 2020, 2600 of the confirmed cases in Catalonia are healthcare workers, representing the 16%. Besides their obvious increased risk of being infected, the healthcare workers facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics at frontline (emergency rooms, ICUs and other dept.) are put under a lot of stress and levels of anxiety. This is worse as the tension to the Health Systems increase, they needing to face important ethical dilemmas including triage of patients. Moreover, SARS epidemic proved not only that frontline healthcare workers suffered from chronic stress, but that this lasted at least for one year after the epidemics wave was over [10]. The aim of the present study is to assess the psychological and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 epidemics, and we intend to do this on both the general population and the healthcare workers. An anonymous online survey is been shared through social media networks (including telegram, whatsapp, twitter) in order to get as many responses as possible from individuals of >16 years old. For the healthcare workers subpopulation the questionnaire will be also be distributed via email, posters, institutional websites and other means deemed appropriate (in hospital or other healthcare settings). The anonymous online survey will include questions on sociodemographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and mental health status (through questions related to depression, anxiety, stress and PSTD, which have been used in other studies). We will share the survey through social media using the snowball sampling. We will continuously share the survey in order to collect responses 6 months after the outbreak, to learn how much the impact of it can last. The results obtained will allow us to: - Understand more accurately the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on general population wellbeing. - Measuring the impact on the health-care workers subpopulation which is critical to cope outbreaks is important to design interventions for stress management and enchance infection-control measures and patient care.

Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option used in standard care to improve oxygenation. A case control series of mechanically ventilated confirmed COVID-19 patients was recorded. At stable ventilatory settings, consecutive patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 ""control"" COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt, with an increase in partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). ***  *** Detailed Description *** The clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease is heterogenous, ranging from no symptoms to severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), which may have a poor prognosis. A severe hypoxemia is associated with preserved respiratory mechanical properties, in particular the pulmonary system compliance. The hypoxia during the early phase seems to mainly result from an important ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch associated with an altered pulmonary vasoconstriction. The ""protective"" mechanism called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) normally reduces the blood flow in poorly or non-ventilated areas towards aerated zones leading to reduce the (VA/Q) mismatch. HPV seems poorly functional in COVID-19 severe patients in absence of ""cor pulmonale"". According to the French National agency for Drug Security (ANSM, Paris, France), only iv almitrine is indicated for hypoxic acute respiratory failure as Drug of Major Therapeutic Interest. This molecule is a routine option in the treatment strategy of severe hypoxemia. The investigators studied COVID-19 patients mechanically ventilated at FiO2 1 with a severe intrapulmonary shunt during their early phase. The emergency conditions and the acute high inflow of patients to ICU impeded the design of a randomized control trial. To eliminate the eventuality of a spontaneous evolution of hypoxia, these patients will be compared with control-matched COVID patients treated conventionally.",N/A

Objectives: Primary Objective: Determine timeline of development of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptoms, and serological response after contact with a confirmed case. Secondary Objectives: 1. Determine average time to develop a positive RT-PCR result and a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. 2. Determine proportion of individuals who develop asymptomatic infections. Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result. Secondary Endpoint: 1. SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay result. 2. Symptom checklist. Study Population: We will enroll up to 1,000 (accrual ceiling: 1,050) adult NIH staff members who were exposed to a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by the NIH Occupational Medical Service (OMS) screening.",N/A

This was attributed to: 1. a suggestion that ibuprofen might upregulate ACE-2 thereby increasing the entrance of COVID-19 into the cells.This is based on a single study in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats where ibuprofen decreases cardiac fibrosis. There seems to be no study in man. (https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-confusion-about-safety-of-ibuprofen/a-52824043) These authors noted an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with hypertension or diabetes, and a possible role of Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) which also upregulate ACE-2, as do also thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs. The relevance of this up-regulation seems disputed. 2. an analogy with bacterial soft-tissue infections where more severe infections on NSAIDs are attributed to an immune-depressive action of NSAIDs, or to belated treatment because of initial symptom suppression. 3. fever is a natural response to viral infection, and reduces virus activity: antipyretic activity might reduce natural defenses against viruses. However fever reduction in critically ill patients had no effect on survival. A meta-analysis of fever reduction in children found no difference on outcomes between paracetamol and ibuprofen. However, these assertions are unclear: upregulation of ACEII would increase the risk of infection, not necessarily its severity, and would only apply to the use of NSAIDs before the infection, i.e. chronic exposure. It would be irrelevant to the infection once the patients are infected, i.e., to symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 infection.

Antipyretic effect increasing the risk or the severity of infection would apply equally to all antipyretic agents including paracetamol, which share the same mechanism of action for fever reduction. EMA remains prudent about this assertion (EMA gives advice on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19, 18 March 2020 EMA/136850/2020). These findings raise the question of 1. an indication bias, where more severe cases with more symptoms and higher fever might not respond well to the first line antipyretic paracetamol, so that ibuprofen was then used. (reverse causality) The same has been described with soft-tissue infection 2. the reality of an increased risk in patients chronically on drugs that upregulate ACEII, such as NSAIDs, antihypertensive drugs and especially ACEI or ARB, or antidiabetic drugs and especially thiazolidinediones. 3. the impact of concomitant or pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension or heart failure.

In a few weeks the virus spread and cases started practically all over the world. In February 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic. Severe symptoms have been found in patients mainly with comorbidities and over 50 years of age. At this time there is no proven therapeutic alternative. In vitro studies and observational experiences showed that antimalarial drugs (Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) had antiviral activity and increased viral clearance. Ivermectin, on the other hand, has been shown in vitro to reduce viral replication and in an observational cohort, greater viral clearance with promising clinical results. So far there is no standard of treatment and clinical trials are needed to find effective treatment alternatives. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for serious COVID-19 infections in no critical hospitalized patients. Material and methods: Randomized controlled trial of patients diagnosed with respiratory infection by COVID-19, who present criteria for hospitalization. Randomization will be performed to receive hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg every 12 hours for one day and then 200 mg every 12 hours, to complete a 5-day treatment schedule. Group 2: Ivermectin 12 mg every 24 hours for one day (less than 80 kg) or Ivermectin 18 mg every 24 hours for one day (greater than 80 kg) + placebo until the fifth day. Group 3: Placebo. Prior to randomization, the risk of cardiovascular complications determined by corrected QT interval, related to hydroxychloroquine intake will be assessed. If the patient is at high risk, the allocation will be to ivermectin only or to placebo in an independent randomization, if the risk is low, any of the three groups could be assigned. Outcomes: The primary outcome will be discharge from hospital for improvement. The safety outcomes will be requirement of mechanical intubation, septic shock or death. Viral clearance will also be evaluated by means of PCR, which will be taken on the 5th day after admission, day 14 and 21. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background In late December 2019, the health authorities of the People's Republic of China reported several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On December 31, 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began etiological and epidemiological research on this disease. Three samples of bronchoalveolar lavage were taken from patients from the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan and through various processes they came to identify a new coronavirus that they initially called on January 7, 2020 as: 2019-nCoV. On January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) made the first recommendations on the epidemiological surveillance of this new coronavirus. On January 22, 2020, the first session of the Emergencies Committee was convened by WHO in Geneva, Switzerland and on January 30 Public Health Emergency of International Importance (ESPII) was declared to the 2019 outbreak. On February 11, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy made up of experts, based on the biology, species and type of virus isolated, names this new coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 and responds to ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ""(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 for its acronym in English), the WHO proposes that same day to call the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19. The first case reported in Latin America was in Brazil on February 26 and on the 28th of the same month, Mexico communicates its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in a 35-year-old patient from a trip to Italy. Given the alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19, at a press conference on March 11, 2020, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declares the SARS-CoV-2.5 outbreak as a pandemic. IVERMECTIN The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was rapidly sequenced to allow for a diagnostic test, epidemiological follow-up, and the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies, however, to date there is no evidence from clinical trials for any therapy that improves the evolution of patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. New potential candidates for the treatment of this disease have emerged. A preclinical study showed that ivermectin, an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, reduces the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic that has shown antiviral activity against a broad group of viruses in recent years. It has been shown to inhibit the import of HIV viral integrase into the nucleus of human cells and also replication of the virus. It does something similar with other proteins of the SV40 virus and the dengue virus. It has also been shown to limit the infection of RNA viruses such as dengue, West Nile virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and influenza virus. It has also been shown to be effective against DNA viruses such as pseudorabies of the mice. On the other hand, it has not been shown to be effective against the zika virus in mice, although this should be re-evaluated. Studies on the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus have revealed that the alpha/beta1 importin of the virus plays a role in infection in relation to intracellular signals of the capsid protein, which may have an impact on the division of host cells. Studies in cultures of infected cells show that ivermectin has a potent antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 and opens up hopeful expectations for using this antiparasitic in the early treatment of COVID-19 which is likely to help reduce the viral load, prevent progression to severe phase and limit person-to-person transmission. Therefore, the development of clinical protocols comparing it with other antivirals with alternate mechanisms of action is important and should be established as soon as possible. In the study by Patel et al., Ivermectin was evaluated in a cohort of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. In the ivermectin group, they were admitted to a dose of 150mcg/kg once they were intubated and observed a significant reduction in mortality, as well as significant reductions in the length of hospitalization and days in the intensive care unit. Hydroxychloroquine Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used for more than a century. They have been used not only for malaria but also in rheumatic conditions due to their anti-inflammatory properties and good safety profile. That is why, in the midst of a pandemic, the question of the use of antimalarials in the treatment and prophylaxis of covid-19 has been raised. Kayaerts et al. demonstrated the inhibition of SARS-CoV by chloroquine in Vero E6 cells at different post-infection times. Vincent et al. demonstrated the dose-dependent inhibition effect of the virus on Vero E6 cells immediately after viral absorption and also 3 to 5 hours later. They also demonstrated that the cells pre-treated with CQ were refractory to the virus in addition to improving terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor, decreasing the viral affinity for the receptor and also reducing the onset of infection. The above illustrates the possibility of using HCQ for prophylaxis or treatment against SARS-CoV. Due to the similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS virus, several studies have proposed the use of HCQ and CQ for management of the current pandemic. Wang et al. tested the in vitro effect of several antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America. Remdesivir showed blocking of viral infection after virus entry with an Effective Concentration of 50% (EC50) of 0.77 μM and a cytotoxic concentration of 50% (CC50) greater than 100μM. Chloroquine had an EC50 = 1.13μM, and a CC50 greater than 100μM and an EC90 of 6.9μM. Chloroquine was effective at the viral entry and post-entry level, while remdesivir was only effective at the post-entry level. The above suggests a possible use of CQ as a prophylactic for SARS-CoV-2.19 infection. Yao et al. Also tested the effect of HCQ and CQ in vitro. They tested the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Physiology-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately integrating their in vitro data. Using PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in the lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the safety profile of the drug. In this study, it was found that HCQ (EC50 = 0.72 μM) is more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on the results of the PBPK models, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of orally administered hydroxychloroquine sulfate is recommended, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days for infection by SARS-CoV-2, since it reached three times the potency of CQ phosphate when administered 500 mg twice a day 5 days in advance. Gao et al. demonstrated the superiority of CQ over control treatment in more than 100 patients with respect to inhibition of exacerbation of pneumonia, improvement in lung imaging findings, promoting negative virus conversion and shortening the course of disease in more than 10 hospitals in China. Gautret et al. treated 20 patients with hydroxychloroquine and compared the results with 16 controls in France. They used PCR to measure viral load on days 3, 4, 5, and 6 post-inclusion. The treatment group had a higher mean age, but no gender difference was made between the two groups. Asymptomatic patients and patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were treated. They concluded that HCQ was effective in reducing viral load. The results on day 3 indicated that 50% of the patients treated with HCQ had a reduction in viral load (p = 0.005), on day 4 it showed a 60% reduction (p = 0.04) on day 5, a 65% reduction (p= 0.006) and on day 6, 70% of the patients showed a reduction in the viral load (p= 0.001). Furthermore, they described the synergistic effect of azithromycin when used in conjunction with HCQ to decrease viral load. Dual treatment showed a 100% decrease in viral load (p <0.001) for day 6, while hydroxychloroquine alone showed a 70% decrease. In the recently published recommendations of the American Society for Infectious Diseases (IDSA) on April 11, 2020, it is established that in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ / CQ should only be given in the context of a clinical trial. The best evidence currently available has failed to demonstrate or exclude a beneficial effect of HCQ on the clinical progression of COVID-19, as inferred by radiological findings, or on viral clearance by means of PCR tests, although a somewhat higher proportion in the HCQ group experienced clinical improvement (RR: 1.47; 95% CI 1.02 - 2.11, p=0.04). However, the certainty in the evidence was rated as very low mainly due to small sample sizes, co-interventions, and risk of bias due to methodological limitations. Furthermore, the selected results should be considered indirect, since significant patient outcomes (eg, mortality, rate of progression to ARDS, and need for mechanical ventilation) were not available. Studies evaluating the addition of azithromycin (AZ) to HCQ provided indirect comparisons of failure of virological clearance with historical controls. The observed risk of mortality among patients who received HCQ + AZ during the hospitalization was 3.4% (6/175 patients). However, an estimated mortality rate in an untreated cohort was not provided in the manuscript. Compared to the lack of viral clearance in historical controls (100% virological failure), 12 symptomatic patients were compared on day 5 or 6 of a separate hospital in France. Patients who received HCQ + AZ treatment experienced numerically fewer cases of virologic failure (43% combined virologic failure; 29/71 patients). There is very low certainty in this comparison of treatment effect, mainly due to very high risk selection bias, making any claims of effectiveness highly uncertain. Furthermore, relying on intermediate outcomes, such as viral clearance to determine important outcomes for the patient (including a reduction in the development of pneumonia, hospital or ICU admission, or the need for intubation) adds another layer of imprecision. Finally, Barbosa et al conducted a comparative study of hospitalized adults with viral pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 during the last two weeks of March 2020. A group receiving HCQ and support measures against another group that only received support measures. The primary endpoints were the effect of hydroxychloroquine use on the need to increase respiratory support, change in lymphocyte count, and change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. In this study, of 63 included patients, 32 were assigned to the HCQ arm. The administration of HCQ was associated with the need to increase the degree of ventilatory support compared to those who did not receive HCQ for 5 days (p = 0.013). The change in total lymphocytes in the HCQ group was not different from that in the group that only received support measures. These authors concluded that the use of HCQ tends to worsen the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio compared to the group that only received supportive measures, in addition to the fact that the use of HCQ was found to increase the risk that the patient required ventilatory management with intubation. Definition of the problem Due to the high rate of spread of COVID-19 infection, associated with a high rate of hospitalization due to respiratory failure, empirical treatment of active agents in vitro has become a common practice. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have demonstrated viral inhibition in vitro and observational experiences have proposed them as potentially safe alternatives with clinical efficacy. The proposed treatments have an adequate margin of safety, in addition to the fact that we have extensive clinical experience because they were previously used in humans to treat malaria, rheumatologic diseases, or parasitosis. Due to this, in conjunction with the urgent need to seek therapeutic alternatives, controlled studies are required without assuming efficacy. Justification COVID-19 infection has collapsed health systems in industrialized countries due to the large number of patients requiring respiratory assistance. There is no standard treatment for the management of this infection and the focus has been on the already known life support and management of Adult Respiratory Failure Syndrome in critically ill patients. The treatments used empirically have an adequate safety profile due to the experience in other clinical settings. The use of these empirical alternatives should be based on clinical trials since efficacy and safety should not be assumed in the group of patients with COVID-19. The Miguel Hidalgo Centennial Hospital has been assigned as a hospitalization center for COVID-19 patients in Aguascalientes Mexico. Hypothesis Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin will be superior to placebo, with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of complications (intubation, septic shock, or death).",Phase 3

Qualitative assessments of lung morphology have been identified to describe macroscopic characteristics of this infection upon admission and during the hospitalization of patients. At the moment, there are no studies that have exhaustively described the parenchymal lung damage induced by SARS-CoV2 by quantitative analysis. The hypothesis of this study is that specific morphological and quantitative alterations of the lung parenchyma assessed by means of CT scan in patients suffering from severe respiratory insufficiency induced by SARS-CoV2 may have an impact on the severity of the degree of alteration of the respiratory exchanges (oxygenation and clearance of the CO2) and have an impact on patient outcome. The presence of characteristic lung morphological patterns assessed by CT scan could allow the recognition of specific patient clusters who can benefit from intensive treatment differently, making a significant contribution to stratifying the severity of patients and their risk of mortality. This is an exploratory clinical descriptive study of lung CT images in a completely new patient population who are nucleic acid amplification test confirmed SARS-CoV2 positive. SAMPLE SIZE (n. patients): The study will collect all patients with the inclusion criteria; a total of 500 patients are expected to be collected. About 80 patients will be enrolled for each local experimental center. The following patient data will be analyzed: - blood gas analytical data assigned to the CT scan, checks performed upon entering the hospital, at the time of performing the CT scan, admission to intensive care and 7 days after entry - patient characteristics such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI) - comorbidity - presence of organ dysfunction with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) - laboratory data relating to hospital admission and symptoms prior to hospitalization. - ventilator and hemodynamic parameters upon entering the hospital, at the time of carrying out the CT scan, upon admission to intensive care and 7 days after entry. The machine learning approach of lung CT scan analysis will aim at evaluating: 1. Quantitative and qualitative lung alterations; 2. The stratification of such morphological characteristics in specific morphological lung clusters identified by the means of artificial intelligence using deep learning algorithms. ETHICAL ASPECTS: The lung CT scan images will be collected and anonymized. Images will be subsequently sent by University of Milano-Bicocca Institutional google drive account to the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and the Department of Radiology in a deidentified format for advanced quantitative analysis taking advantage of artificial intelligence using deep learning algorithms. The data will be collected in a pseudo-anonymous way through paper Case Report Form (CRF) and analyzed by the scientific coordinator of the project. Given the retrospective nature of the study and in the presence of technical difficult in obtaining an informed consent of patients in this period of pandemic emergency, informed consent will be waived. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Continuous data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median and interquartile range, according to data distribution that will be evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables will be expressed as proportions (frequency). The deep learning segmentation algorithm will segment the lung parenchyma from the entire CT lung. Lung volume, lung weight and opacity intensity distribution analysis will be applied. Second, clustering analysis to stratify the patients will be performed. Both an intensity and a spatial clustering algorithm will be tested. Third, a model will be trained to predict the injury progression using the images and all other patient data. Statistical significance will be considered in the presence of a p<0.05 (two-tailed).",N/A

The disease caused by this coronavirus (COVID-19), which is transmitted by air via droplets, is potentially responsible for a severe respiratory syndrome but also for a multivisceral deficiency that can lead to death. Cancer patients are generally more susceptible to infections than people without cancer due to immunosuppression caused by their tumor disease and/or conventional anti-cancer treatments used such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, several targeted therapies, radiotherapy or recent surgery. These patients may therefore be at particular risk for COVID-19. This is suggested by the very first analysis on the subject, which reports data from the Chinese prospective database of 2007 patients with proven COVID-19 infection in 575 hospitals in 31 Chinese provinces. The authors of this publication conclude with 3 measures to be proposed to patients undergoing cancer follow-up: 1/ consider postponing adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery in the case of localized and stable cancer, 2/ reinforce protective measures for these patients, and 3/ monitor very closely and treat these patients more intensively when they have a COVID-19. However, the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe forms of COVID-19 in cancer patients suggested by this first study remains to be demonstrated given its limitations, already highlighted by other authors. Indeed, the number of patients is small and the population of cancer patients is very heterogeneous, with in particular 12 patients out of 16 who had recovered from initial cancer treatments (therefore without immunosuppression), half of whom had a disease course of more than 4 years. Nevertheless, a second Chinese study has just recently been published, reporting COVID-19 data among 1524 cancer patients admitted between December 30, 2019 and February 17, 2020 in the Department of Radiotherapy and Medical Oncology of the University Hospital of Wuhan, the source city of the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the rate of CoV-2 SARS infection was lower than that reported in the first study, it was still 0.79% (n=12), which is much higher than the rate of COVID-19 diagnosed in Wuhan City during the same period (0.37%, 41 152/11 081 000). Again, lung cancer was the main tumour location observed in 7 patients (58%), of which 5 (42%) were undergoing chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. Three deaths (25%) were reported. Patients over 60 years of age with lung cancer had a higher incidence of COVID-19 (4.3% vs. 1.8%). Thus, it appears that the risk of COVID-19 is actually increased in cancer patients, although again, less than half of the patients with lung cancer had a higher incidence of COVID-19. Moreover, two more recent studies performed in patients treated in Hubei Province of China and in New-York city found that patients with cancer had significantly increased risk of death compared to non-cancer COVID-19 patients, especially patients with metastatic cancer and those who had recent surgery. Therefore, many questions remain to date on the level of risk and the severity of COVID-19 in patients with active cancer, in particular those under anti-cancer treatment and in patients recently operated for localized cancer. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Since December 2019, China and then the rest of the world have been affected by the rapid development of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2). The disease caused by this coronavirus (COVID-19), which is transmitted by air via droplets, is potentially responsible for a severe respiratory syndrome but also for a multivisceral deficiency that can lead to death. In less than 3 months, the COVID-19 epidemic has already affected more than 440,000 persons and has been responsible for more than 20,000 deaths worldwide. Cancer patients are generally more susceptible to infections than people without cancer due to immunosuppression caused by their tumor disease and/or conventional anti-cancer treatments used such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, several targeted therapies, radiotherapy or recent surgery. These patients may therefore be at particular risk for COVID-19. This is suggested by the very first analysis on the subject, which reports data from the Chinese prospective database of 2007 patients with proven COVID-19 infection in 575 hospitals in 31 Chinese provinces. After exclusion of 417 cases without sufficient available clinical data, 1590 cases of patients infected with COVID-19 were analysed, of which 18 (1%) had a personal history of cancer. This prevalence was higher than that of COVID-19 in the general Chinese population since the beginning of the epidemic (0.29%). Lung cancer (n=5, 28%) and colorectal cancer (n=5, 28%) were the 2 most common cancers. Four (25%) of the 16 patients for whom treatment was known had received chemotherapy or had surgery in the month prior to COVID-19 infection, while the majority (n=12, 75%) were patients in remission or cured of their cancer after primary surgery. Compared to patients without cancer, patients with cancer were older (63 years vs. 48 years) and had a more frequent history of smoking (22% vs. 7%). Most importantly, patients with cancer had more severe forms of COVID-19 than patients without cancer (7/18 or 39% vs. 124/1572 or 8%, p=0.0003). Patients who had chemotherapy or surgery in the month preceding the diagnosis of COVID-19 had a significantly increased risk of the severe form (3/4 or 75% vs. 6/14 or 43%), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis after adjustment on other risk factors such as age, smoking and other comorbidities, with a relative risk of 5.34 (95% CI: 1.80-16.18;p=0.0026). Finally, patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than patients without cancer (13 days vs. 43 days, p<0.0001). The authors of this publication conclude with 3 measures to be proposed to patients undergoing cancer follow-up: 1/ consider postponing adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery in the case of localized and stable cancer, 2/ reinforce protective measures for these patients, and 3/ monitor very closely and treat these patients more intensively when they have a COVID-19. However, the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe forms of COVID-19 in cancer patients suggested by this first study remains to be demonstrated given its limitations, already highlighted by other authors. Indeed, the number of patients is small and the population of cancer patients is very heterogeneous, with in particular 12 patients out of 16 who had recovered from initial cancer treatments (therefore without immunosuppression), half of whom had a disease course of more than 4 years.

In a retrospective observational study, we will review patient data, diagnostic data and treatment data over a three-month period since the onset of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. This data will be compared with data from the corresponding time frame during the years 2015 to 2019. ***  *** Detailed Description *** In the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic there is a concern about an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) concurrent with the infection, including both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (Klok et al. 2020; Cui et al. 2020; Helms et al. 2020; Leonard-Lorant et al. 2020; Poissy et al. 2020). International guidelines now recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients with a SARS-COV-2 infection in the absence of any contraindication (Thachil et al. 2020). The majority of the studies on VTE in SARS-COV-2 infections have been carried out in the ICU and show prevalence of VTE of between 20 and 30%.(Klok et al. 2020; Cui et al. 2020; Helms et al. 2020). This is a clear increase compared to the less than 10 % prevalence seen in other ICU patients (Muscedere, Heyland, and Cook 2007; Deborah Cook et al. 2005; D. Cook et al. 2000). However, a single center study on consecutive ICU patients with severe sepsis showed a prevalence of VTE of 37% (Kaplan et al. 2015) and another recent publication of patients with severe H1N1 infection had a prevalence of VTE of 44% (Obi et al. 2019). This raises the question whether the increase in VTE seen in recent publications of SARS-COV-2 infections is the result of the specific pathophysiology of the virus itself or the subsequent sepsis with multiorgan failure seen in most complicated and severe cases. The former would have large implications for patients treated outside the ICU and possibly outside hospitals (Thachil et al. 2020). The aim of this study will be to investigate the prevalence of VTE in a regional healthcare system prior to, and during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the differences between ICU, hospitalized and outpatient cohorts.",N/A

Multicenter studies from China report that key markers of inflammation and/or coagulopathy are associated with morbidity and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-dimer levels (that are sometime greater than 4 or 6 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) are strongly associated with mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. Recent data also shows that mortality among COVID-19 patients is markedly higher in patients with elevated Troponin-T (TnT) levels than in patients with normal TnT levels. Recently a cohort of 81 patients retrospectively evaluated diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and reported a lower extremity VTE incidence of 25% (20/81) and a mortality of 40% (8/20) in the presence of VTE. Reported a case of bilateral pulmonary embolism in a 75 year old woman diagnosed with severe COVID-19, in the absence of predisposing risk factors and a negative lower extremity US. Lastly the investigated use of Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) in the treatment of COVID-19 associated ARDS and reported promising, but transient, results in terms of pulmonary function improvement. It appears that either the SARS-CoV2 infection itself induces a hypercoagulable state, possibly by hypofibrinolytic mechanisms, or the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces a prothrombotic state, which leads to clinical deterioration, hypoxia and hemodynamic instability secondary to thromboembolic phenomena and potentially cardiac ischemia. Preliminary data from Northwell Health System, which has one of the largest populations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US, reveals a positivity rate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of 40% of those COVID-19 patients screened by Doppler compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities. Heparin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition to its anticoagulation effect, which could play a beneficial role in sepsis. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that the large negatively charged sulfated glycosaminoglycans of unfractionated heparin may act as an alternate ligand for the SARS-CoV2 receptor irrespective of ACE2. Whether this in vitro evidence supports the role of a protective or deleterious mechanism in COVID-19 infection is not known. However, an early report with empiric use of treatment dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) in ARDS from a different viral family, influenza H1N1, revealed that H1N1 ARDS patients under systemic anticoagulation had 33-fold fewer VTE events than those treated given prophylactic doses of UFH/low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis. Very recent evidence suggests that therapy with prophylactic to intermediate doses of the LMWH enoxaparin (30mg to 60mg QD) in severe hospitalized COVID-19 patents with a SIC score ≥ 4 or D-dimer (Dd) > 6 X ULN improves outcomes and prognosis. All-cause mortality at 28 days was reduced from 64.2% to 40.0% in those patients with a SIC score ≥ 4 (p=0.029), and from 52.4% to 32.8% in those patients with an elevated Dd > 6 x ULN (P=0.017). Notably, Klok and colleagues investigated 184 ICU patients infected with COVID-19 and reported a 13% mortality rate, a relatively high incidence of CTPA- or ultrasonography-confirmed VTE rate (27%), and arterial thrombotic events (3.7%) despite the use of standard dose thromboprophylaxis. Postulated mechanisms for the improved prognosis with the use of treatment doses of LMWH in the sick COVID-19 population include the decrease in the risk of microthrombi, especially in the pulmonary vasculature, which can lead to hypoxemia, pulmonary vasoconstriction and right ventricular dysfunction as well as the decrease in the risk of progression to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy as a contributor to the high mortality seen in these patients. The optimal dose of heparin (either LMWH or UFH) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is unknown, as patients on conventional prophylactic dose heparin (UFH or LMWH) as supported by international guidance statements on hospitalized COVID-19 patients appear to remain at risk for thromboembolic events. There is data to support improved efficacy with treatment doses of twice daily enoxaparin versus once-daily weight-adjusted enoxaparin for the management of VTE, especially with large thrombus burden. There is also long-standing data to support that treatment-dose heparin can reduce major cardiovascular events. Our current standard of care in our 24 hospital Northwell Health System, which has a very large hospitalized COVID-19 patient population, is to use Lovenox 40mg subcutaneous (SQ) once a day (QD) for patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) < 30 and Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) > 15ml/min, Lovenox 40mg SQ twice a day (BID) for patients with a BMI > 30 and CrCl > 15ml/min, and UFH 5000U SQ BID or three times a day (TID) in patients with a CrCl < 15ml/min and BMI < 30 and UFH 7500U SQ BID or TID with a CrCl < 15ml/min and BMI > 30. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that prophylaxis of severe COVID-19 patients with treatment dose LMWH leads to better thromboembolic-free outcomes and associated complications during hospitalization than prophylaxis with our institution's current standard of care with prophylactic to intermediate-doses of LMWH.",Phase 3

One symptom of COVID-19 is a reduction in the number of cells called lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights infections. With fewer lymphocytes, the body cannot effectively fight back against SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Researchers want to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 affects these blood cells. This information may give them ideas for new treatments. Objective: To learn more about how SARS-CoV-2 affects lymphocytes, the immune, and the blood clotting system. Eligibility: Adults age 18 and older who either currently have COVID-19 or have recently recovered from it Design: Participants will give a blood sample. For this, a needle is used to collect blood from an arm vein. For participants who have a central line, blood will be collected through that instead. Participants medical records related to COVID-19 will be reviewed. Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 will be asked to undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells. For this, blood is taken from a needle placed in one arm. A machine separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the participant through a needle placed in the other arm. This takes about 2-3 hours. Recovered participants may have material collected from inside the nostrils and/or rectum. This is done by gently rubbing the area with a sterile cotton swab. Recovered participants may have an echocardiogram to look at their heart. For this, a small probe is held against the chest to get pictures of the heart from different angles. This takes less than 30 minutes. Participation lasts 1-2 days on most cases and may be split in a few visits for recovered patients if leukapheresis and echocardiogram are done. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a pandemic with a wide range of manifestations. One of the hallmarks of severe illness is the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, coagulopathy, and lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is a robust and consistent predictor of mortality in COVID-19. Understanding the intersection of inflammation, complement activation, endothelial damage, and coagulation is critical to a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis. This is a multisite study that will conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. We will recruit patients with mild to severe COVID-19, as well as patients who have recently recovered from the disease. Participants will have 1-2 study visits to have blood drawn via venipuncture or available venous access, with optional leukapheresis, nasal and rectal swabs, and echocardiogram for recovered patients. Blood will be used for genetic testing, lymphocyte phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other research tests.

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. As of 25 February 2020, at least 77 785 cases and 2666 deaths had been identified across China and in other countries; in particular, 977 and 861 cases were identified in South Korea and Japan, respectively. The outbreak has already caused global alarm. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and issued advice in the form of temporary recommendations under the International Health Regulations (IHR).It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence that is 75%-80% identical to that of SARS-CoV, and has more similarities to several bat coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh reported human-infecting member of the family Coronaviridae, which also includes SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. It has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. Both the clinical and the epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality. About 16%-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill, with a 2%-3% mortality rate. However, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease and explore the clinical effect of antiviral drugs. One efficient approach to discover effective drugs is to test whether the existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating other related viral infections. Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon (IFN), Favipiravir (FPV), and Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV), have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial. It has recently been demonstrated that, as a prodrug, Favipiravir (half maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 61.88 μmol·L−1, half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) > 400 μmol·L−1, selectivity index (SI) > 6.46) effectively inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586). Furthermore, other reports show that FPV is effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 μmol·L−1. Therefore, clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this antiviral nucleoside for COVID-19 treatment. After enrollment of the patients (day 1) depending on inclusion and exclusion criteria and laboratory findings confirming the presence of the COVID-19 virus, 25 patients will receive Favipiravir plus standard treatment and the second group of 25 patients will receive standard treatment only. The comparison of the findings of the follow up studies on days 4, 7, and 10 in terms of clinical manifestations, chest X-ray and laboratory findings, such as Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) results for viral presence will determine whether Favipiravir has safety and efficacy against COVID-19 infections. All ethical issues related to this trial including right of the participants to withdraw from the study should be maintained according to of guidelines of International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP). ***  *** Detailed Description *** •Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. It was initially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring influenza A virus subtype (H1N1) influenza a pandemic in 2009. No drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Numerous antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines are being investigated and developed as potential therapies Fujifilm Toyama Chemical has started a Phase III clinical trial of its antiviral influenza drug Avigan (favipiravir) for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Japan. Avigan specifically blocks RNA polymerase associated with influenza viral replication. The mechanism is expected to have an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. In Japan, the new Phase III trial will assess Avigan's safety and efficacy as a potential Covid-19 treatment. Last month, China's Science and Technology Ministry official Zhang Xinmin said that favipiravir helped patients recover in an 80-day participant trial conducted in Shenzhen city. According to the study data, the drug was able to shorten the recovery time from 11 days to four days for mild and moderate cases. Favipiravir secured Chinese approval for manufacturing by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical to treat adults with new or recurring influenza. It also holds approval in China as an investigational treatment for Covid-19. A drug developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical in Japan is showing promising outcomes in treating at least mild to moderate cases of COVID-19, Live Science previously reported. The antiviral drug, called Favipiravir or Avigan, has been used in Japan to treat influenza, and last month, the drug was approved as an experimental treatment for COVID-19 infection. The drug, which works by preventing certain viruses from replicating, seemed to shorten the duration of the virus as well as improve lung conditions (as seen in X-rays) in tested patients. A few studies have been published in international journals regarding the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir. However, this type of study on Favipiravir (Favipira) has not yet been done in our country. This is the rationale why we have designed this clinical trial in Bangladesh to fight against COVID-19 a global pandemic. Objectives: •General Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir (Favipira) for the treatment of COVID-19 in a group of Bangladeshi patients Specific objectives: Primary end point: •To assess the treatment efficacy: Negative for the virus at 4-10 days after initiation of therapy. However, negative results for the viral presence should be with an interval of at least 24 hours. - To assess the treatment efficacy: X-ray findings of lung condition improvement at Day-4, Day-7 and Day-10 of therapy. Secondary end point: - Clinical recovery rate at 7-10 days of therapy and reduced duration of fever, cough, relief time auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate. - To assess the adverse effects of drug. - ICU admission rate - Mortality rate Hypothesis Favipiravir might be an effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Methodology: Study design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control study. Randomization will be done by computerized randomization table. Place of study: Mahanagar General Hospital, Dhaka (Site-1), Mugda Medical College Hospital, Dhaka (Site-2), Kurmitola General Hospital, Dhaka (Site-3), Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka (Site-4) Duration of study: 2 months Study population: Clinically and Laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 Formulae: Variable Notations: Α, the probability of type I error (significance level) is the probability of rejecting the true null hypothesis (0.05) Β, the probability of type II error (1 - power of the test) is the probability of failing to reject the false null hypothesis (0.80). PA (proportion of discordant pairs of type A) among discordant pairs (1/4) PD (proportion of discordant) pairs among all pairs (0.25) Npairs, required sample size pair =25*2=50 A matched-pair design is used, in which patients are matched on age and clinical stage of COVID-19, with one patient in a matched pair assigned to treatment case and the other to treatment control. It is estimated that patients in a matched pair will respond similarly to the treatments in 85% of matched pairs. How many matched pairs need to be enrolled in the study to have a 90% chance of finding a significant difference using a two-sided test with type I error = 0.05? So, we will recruit a total of 50 patients Randomization will be done by computerized randomization table Group A Patient (25) = Favipiravir + Standard Treatment Group B Patient (25) = Only Standard Treatment For better result sample size may be multiply on the basis of availability of COVID-19 patient in the study hospital. Diagnostic Criteria All patients diagnosed as COVID-19 positive on the basis of clinical and Laboratory findings. If the respiratory specimens give positive results upon RT-PCR analysis at the lab targeting conserved viral gene(s), such as E gene and or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or other COVID-19 specific genes, it will be considered as confirmed positive case for COVID-19. Data Collection Procedure: Patient admitted in Isolation ward with COVID-19 positive will be used. Study population again will be confirmed by laboratory findings. Patients will be selected for the study following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Written consent will be taken from the patient for treatment with Favipiravir. After data collection, data will be analyzed for result. Finally, Summary and conclusion will be published. Background of Data Collectors at the clinical sites: Data will be collected by Co-investigators of the study who are employed as physicians in the Isolation word for COVID-19 positive patients in the designated hospitals. Co-investigators are familiar about the data collection procedure as per clinical trial protocol. Precaution and safety of the Data Collectors including physicians, laboratory personnel, nurses, and medical technologists: Data Collectors should fill up data collection sheet properly. Proper monitoring of the patient should be carefully done. Data collectors must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gown, N95 mask, hand gloves, head coverings and goggles to protect themselves. I case, anyone involved in the study get infected, he/she should be sent to the designated isolation unit/quarantine to mitigate spread of the disease and get treatment. Treatment: Favipiravir 200 mg (Favipira) tablet will be given orally. Day 1: Tablet Favipiravir 1600 mg twice daily Days 2−Days 10: Tablet Favipiravir 600 mg twice daily. Group A Patient (25) = Favipiravir + Standard Treatment Group B Patient (25) = Only Standard Treatment Standard treatment included oxygen inhalation, oral or intravenous rehydration, electrolyte correction, antipyretics, analgesics, antibiotics and antiemetic drugs & the medication any patient is on due to any concomitant diseases. Management of adverse events: It has been suggested that host cell enzymes (cellular kinases) convert Favipiravir into Favipiravir ribofuranosyl phosphate, a form that inhibits virus polymerase without affecting host cellular RNA or DNA synthesis. Research documents indicate that Favipiravir is a well-tolerated drug with some side effects like headache, nausea and hypersensivity. On prolong treatment it may develop inflammation of liver and kidney, abortion, intrauterine fetal death, and congenital anomalies of newborn baby. Considering the longterm effects of Favipiravir, patients with Chronic liver and kidney disease, previous history of allergic reactions to Favipiravir, Pregnant or lactating women, Women of a childbearing age with a positive pregnancy test and having history of Miscarriage, or within 2 weeks after delivery have been excluded in the study proposal. Management of side effects like headache, nausea and hypersensitivity will counter at the early stage of onset and all medicines and instruments will be kept available at the ward near the patient bed for prompt management during treatment with Favipiravir. Any adverse or side effect will be managed immediately with standard treatment procedure with discontinuation of the test drug Research physicians under the supervision of Clinical Trial Monitors will monitor clinically all the vital signs along with adverse symptoms (if any arise) routinely and be available for taking measures against any side or adverse effect. They will record all the events clinically along with the routine data collection. For any occurrence due mismanagement with the side effects of Favipiravir, the entire research team will be responsible. Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting time: If any adverse drug reaction occurs during study period it should be reported within 24 hours of the event to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) in order to assess the risk and quick action should be taken. Laboratory data collection Blood and respiratory samples will be collected by trained medical technologist and transported immediately to Institute for developing Science and Health initiatives (ideSHi) for analysis. Cool chain will be maintained during sample transportation. Blood sample analysis at the laboratory will be done by trained research officers and fellows. On the other hand, RT-PCR using respiratory samples for viral detection will be done by expert molecular biologist. Follow-up System: Baseline clinical symptoms and Laboratory findings will be monitored from first day and follow up will be continued at Day-4, Day-7 and Day-10. Viral clearance will be checked by RT-PCR at Day-4, Day-7 and Day-10. X-ray findings will be monitored from Day-1 followed by Day-4, Day-7 and Day-10 to see the lung condition. Any Side effects of drugs will be documented. Statistical Analysis: All data will be analyzed by using the statistical package for social science (SPSS) 22. All data will be provided as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Chi-square test will be used to compare differences between the frequencies. Serum cytokines levels will be analyzed using the normality test. P value < 0.05 will be considered significant. •Utilization of Results: A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. According to world health organization (WHO), COVID-19 updates on 10th April, 2020, globally confirmed cases were 16,17,204, confirmed deaths were 97,039, recovered 364686 peoples. In Bangladesh confirmed cases were 424, confirmed deaths were 27, recovered 33 peoples. No drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Numerous antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines are being investigated and developed as potential therapies.

If severe respiratory disease is the form that constitutes the extreme gravity of the disease (mortality, with more than 170,000 deaths worldwide to date). However, there is a great heterogeneity of clinical forms with asymptomatic or symptomatic pauci forms, moderate forms, up to severe forms. Different symptoms may appear: fever, cough, asthenia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal forms, anosmia and / or ageusia, skin involvement, etc. Given the novelty of this infection, several questions remain: - What are all the symptoms that can be contracted by a COVID-19 patient? - Are there clinical forms not described? - What is the evolutionary profile, the healing time of this disease in patients treated on an outpatient basis? - What are the factors associated with a prolonged form of COVID-19 disease, including on an outpatient basis? ***  *** Detailed Description *** Most of the descriptive studies relating to COVID-19 relate to the severe forms of the disease managed in the hospital sector. Few data have been published on moderate forms, requiring no hospitalization, of strict outpatient management. These so-called moderate forms, however, constitute the majority of cases of COVID-19 (approximately 80%). In the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department of Pitie Salpetriere, COVIDOM pilot site, at the beginning of March, during the intensification of the epidemic in France, a weekly telephone consultation was set up to take care of people tested for COVID + by PCR, or people not tested by PCR, or even tested with negative PCR but symptomatic and followed at home, suffering from moderate form of COVID-19, as well as their contact cases if they wished. Telemedicine is particularly suitable in this epidemic context, ensuring continuity of care, while limiting face-to-face consultations, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination. Given the novelty of this infection, it is important to be able to best characterize these ambulatory forms, as well as their evolution, in order to manage these patients, and to offer primary care physicians a more detailed description of these forms. , which they are and will be called upon to take care of, general medicine being central to dealing with the epidemic.",N/A

While no data exist on nutritional intake post-ICU in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, significant nutritional deficits in other cohorts of ICU survivors have been demonstrated. Further, similar conditions, such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, are associated with substantial acute weight loss during hospitalisation, with long-term muscle weakness and functional impairments. If they survive, patients with COVID-19 are likely to have prolonged recovery and stay in hospital for a significant length of time. Coupled with stretched healthcare resources, this cohort of patients may be particularly susceptible to nutritional deficits, declining nutritional status, and poor functional recovery.

In the United States, the number of cases of COVID-19 ARDS is projected to exceed the number of available ventilators. Reports from China and Italy indicate that 22-64% of critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS will die. ARDS currently has no evidence-based treatments other than low tidal ventilation to limit mechanical stress on the lung and prone positioning. A new therapeutic approach capable of rapidly treating and attenuating ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is urgently needed. The dominant pathologic feature of viral-induced ARDS is fibrin accumulation in the microvasculature and airspaces. Substantial preclinical work suggests antifibrinolytic therapy attenuates infection provoked ARDS. In 2001, a phase I trial 7 demonstrated the urokinase and streptokinase were effective in patients with terminal ARDS, markedly improving oxygen delivery and reducing an expected mortality in that specific patient cohort from 100% to 70%. A more contemporary approach to thrombolytic therapy is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to its higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk 8. We therefore propose a phase IIa clinical trial with two intravenous (IV) tPA treatment arms and a control arm to test the efficacy and safety of IV tPA in improving respiratory function and oxygenation, and consequently, successful extubation, duration of mechanical ventilation and survival. ***  *** Detailed Description *** As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates, cases have grown exponentially around the world. Other countries' experience suggests that 5-16% of COVID-19 in-patients will undergo prolonged intensive care with 50-70% needing mechanical ventilation(MV) threatening to overwhelm hospital capacity. ARDS has no effective treatment besides supportive care, the use of ventilation strategies encompassing low tidal volumes that limit trans-pulmonary pressures, and prone positioning in severe disease. Most current trials in clinicaltrials.gov for COVID-19-induced ARDS aim at modulating the inflammatory response or test anti-viral drugs. Sarilumab and tocilizumab that block IL-6 effects are being tested in RCT for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (NCT04317092, NCT04322773, NCT04327388). The World Health Organization international trial SOLIDARITY will test remdesivir; chloroquine + hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir + ritonavir; and lopinavir + ritonavir and interferon-beta (NCT04321616). Yet studies targeting the coagulation system, which is intrinsically intertwined with the inflammatory response are lacking. A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the airspaces and lung parenchyma, along with fibrin-platelet microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, which contribute to the development of progressive respiratory dysfunction and right heart failure. Similar to pathologic findings of ARDS, microthrombi have now been observed in lung specimens from patients infected with COVID-19. Inappropriate activation of the clotting system in ARDS results from enhanced activation and propagation of clot formation as well as suppression of fibrinolysis. Our group has shown that low fibrinolysis is associated with ARDS. Studies starting decades ago have demonstrated the systemic and local effects of dysfunctional coagulation in ARDS, specifically related to fibrin. This occurs largely because of excessive amounts of tissue factor that is produced by alveolar epithelial cells and activated alveolar macrophages, and high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) produced and released by endothelial cells. Consistent with this, generalized derangements of the hemostatic system with prolongation of the prothrombin time, elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products have been reported in severely ill COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-survivors. These laboratory findings, in combination with the large clot burden seen in the pulmonary microvasculature, mirrors what is seen in human sepsis, experimental endotoxemia, and massive tissue trauma. Targeting the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems to improve the treatment of ARDS has been proposed for at least the past two decades. In particular, the use of plasminogen activators to limit ARDS progression and reduce ARDS-induced death has received strong support from animal models, and a phase 1 human clinical trial. In 2001, Hardaway and colleagues showed that administration of either urokinase or streptokinase to patients with terminal ARDS reduced the expected mortality from 100% to 70% with no adverse bleeding events. Importantly, the majority of patients who ultimately succumbed died from renal or hepatic failure, rather than pulmonary failure. Consideration of therapies that are widely available but not recognized for this indication and traditionally considered ""high-risk"" such as fibrinolytic agents is warranted in this unprecedented public health emergency, since the risk of adverse events from tPA is far outweighed by the extremely high risk of death in the patient's meeting the eligibility criteria for this trial. While the prior studies by Hardaway et al evaluating fibrinolytic therapy for treatment of ARDS used urokinase and streptokinase, the more contemporary approach to thrombolytic therapy involves the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) due to higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk to the other fibrinolytic agents.",Phase 2

Prospective enrollment from November 2020 to October 2021 in 60 Italian surgical centers. All patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with anastomosis will be included in a prospective database after written informed consent. A total of 3,000 patients is expected based on a mean of 50 cases per center. ***  *** Detailed Description *** BACKGROUND Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal and multifactorial approach to the optimization of perioperative management. In order to modify and improve the response to surgery-induced trauma, the program relies on a series of evidence-based items related to pre-, intra- and post-operative care. Several meta-analyses on ERAS showed a significant reduction of morbidity rates and length of stay after colorectal surgery. However, program implementation outside clinical trials is still extremely variable, as the necessary multidisciplinary involvement makes the program vulnerable to various areas of failure, that explain the great variation in adherence rates to program items. During the early phase of program implementation, adherence rate to program items rarely goes beyond 50%, needing to reach at least 70% in order to significantly improve results (faster recovery and reduced morbidity). Recent cohort studies reported a mean adherence rate to ERAS items between 63 and 75%. In other studies, adherence to ERAS items was higher, reaching up to 90%. Moreover, a clear and significant dose-effect curve between adherence rate to ERAS program items and early outcomes was demonstrated, and recent evidence deriving from retrospective studies suggests that ERAS programs may also offer a definite advantage over long-term survival after colorectal resection for malignancy. While many studies to date have focused on early outcomes (i.e. earlier return of bowel function, lower complication rates, and/or shorter length of inpatient stay), for the majority of oncologic operations, however, postoperative recovery carries the additional demand of returning the patient to adjuvant oncologic therapies. It is still unclear if ERAS program could improve the failure to ""return to intended oncologic therapy"" (RIOT) after cancer surgery due to complications and lingering poor performance status, that is strongly associated with worse oncologic outcomes, including shortened overall survival. Measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) addresses the gap in enhanced recovery assessment by incorporation of patient-centered quality into our global assessment of outcomes. Taken together, these data establish a paradigm for association of perioperative medical care to long-term oncologic outcomes—revealing how the perioperative care team's actions over a relatively short number of days and hours around the time of a cancer surgery can improve cancer-specific survival. The concept is that various perioperative techniques, protocols, and agents will blunt the patient's perioperative stress response, reduce complications, and improve functional recovery after surgery. Together, these effects allow more people to RIOT in a more timely fashion and in a more complete way. To the extent that the combination of preservation of immune competence and more reliable return to adjuvant therapies then reduce recurrence rates, longer and more meaningful survivals may be achieved. Therefore, the Italian Colorectal Anastomotic Leakage study group planned this study to prospectively evaluate the impact of adherence to ERAS program items after colorectal resections on PRO in the whole population and on failure to RIOT for malignant disease. Outcome measures 1. Preoperative risk factors (age, gender, obesity, nutritional status, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease, perioperative steroid therapy, ASA class I-II vs III, SARS-CoV-2 infection) 2. Operative parameters (approach, procedure, anastomotic technique, length of operation, pTNM stage) 3. Adherence to ERAS program items Primary Endpoints 1. Patient-related outcomes measures (PROMs): 2. Return to intended oncologic therapy (RIOT) Secondary Endpoints 3. Anastomotic leakage rate 4. Minor and major complication rates 5. Overall length of postoperative hospital stay (including any readmission) 6. Readmission and reoperation rates Recorded data and follow-up During the postoperative period, the local attending surgeon will make any decision for complementary exams and imaging according to his own criteria, the only exception being the creation of a proximal diverting stoma at operation, that mandates routine check of anastomotic integrity through an intraluminal contrast exam (standard x-rays or CT scan) three to six weeks after the operation. The rate of any complication will be calculated and graded according to Clavien-Dindo including all anastomotic leaks, wound infection (according to the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and wound culture), pneumonia (clinical symptoms, and physical and radiological examinations), central line infection (positive blood culture), urinary tract infection (positive urine culture with bacterial count). Patients will be followed-up in the outpatient clinic up to 8 weeks after discharge from the hospital. Anastomotic dehiscence (any deviation from the planned postoperative course related to the anastomosis, or presence of pus or enteric contents within the drains, presence of abdominal or pelvic collection in the area of the anastomosis on postoperative CT scan, leakage of contrast through the anastomosis during enema or evident anastomotic dehiscence at reoperation for postoperative peritonitis) will be defined and graded according to international consensus guidelines. Anastomotic testing will be performed intraoperatively with the air-leak test (ALT) and using ICG-NIR-NBI with a standard protocol [ICG 25 mg diluted in 10 mL saline (2.5 mg/mL); first bolus i.v. injection of 4 mL (10 mg) after vascular control and mesenteric division, just before proximal and/or distal bowel division; second bolus i.v. injection of 4 mL (10 mg) just before joining anastomotic stumps; third (optional) bolus i.v. injection of 2 mL (5 mg) after the anastomosis is completed; NIR-NBI observation within 60-120"" after every ICG injection (direct, laparoscopic or endoscopic)]. PROM questionnaires will be administered to all enrolled patients four to one week before the planned operation, on the day of discharge (or POD5), and 6 weeks after the operation. RIOT rates will be recorded in all patients submitted to surgery for malignancy, according to national guidelines for colorectal cancer. After anonymization, all data of each single case will be prospectively uploaded by local investigator(s) on a protected web-based database and incorporated into a spreadsheet for data analysis, checking for any discrepancy, that will be addressed and solved through strict cooperation between chief investigator, data manager and participating centers. This study protocol will be submitted to the coordinating center ethics committee (Comitato Etico Regionale delle Marche - C.E.R.M.) for approval and then registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Thereafter, all the participating centers will obtain authorization to participate from the local institutional review board. Anonymized participant-level datasets will be available after study completion upon reasonable request by contacting the principal investigator. Statistical Analysis Quantitative values will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), median and range; categorical data with percentage frequencies. For categorical data, analysis will include the use of cross tabulation, chi squared or Fisher's exact test where indicated. Continues or discrete variables will be analyzed using Student's two-sided t test (allowing for heterogeneity of variances) or with a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test as indicated). Joint and conditional multivariate association between all variables shown to be significant on univariate analysis will be assessed using binary logistic or multiple linear regression. The odds ratio (OR) will be presented followed by 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Concerning comparison of nutritional status scores, areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) will be calculated for all endpoints, considering values from 0.7 to 0.8 as acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 excellent, and above 0.9 as outstanding (40). Differences in AUC-ROC curves will be analyzed with the chi-squared test. Optimal cut-off points will be obtained applying Youden's Index (Sensitivity+Specificity-1), choosing those values of the AUC-ROC curve where this index is maximal. Negative predictive values (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) will also be calculated; finally, a logistic regression model will be built using the presence/absence of endpoint as dependent variable, and nutritional scores ≤ or > the cut-off values as explanatory factors; using logistic transformation of the linear predictors, the probabilities of the endpoint related to the different combinations of factors level will be obtained . For all statistical tests the significant level is fixed at p < .05. Statistical analyses will be carried out using STATA software (Stata Corp. College Station, Texas, USA). Sample size Adherence to at least 70% of the ERAS program items was identified as a cut-off for significant improvement of outcomes , with a 2:1 expected ratio below:above the cut-off. Estimating a reduction of postoperative PRO from preoperative baseline (1.0) at 0.7 for adherence above the cut-off and at 0.64 for adherence below the cut-off, alpha 0.04, beta 0.8, the required sample size is n=2,406 (802 cases above 70% adherence and 1,604 below 70% adherence). Reported rates for failure to RIOT and ERAS program items adherence below or above 70% are 13 and 6.5%, respectively (27); the required sample size for evaluation of failure to RIOT is n=885 (295 cases above 70% adherence and 590 below 70% adherence). Based on previous iCral observational study on colorectal surgery in Italy, the expected ratio of malignant:benign indications to surgery is 70:30 (2,100 resections for malignancy and 900 resections for benign disease on the basis of 3,000 expected cases).",N/A

A customized disease specific understanding will be important to understand subsequent disease waves, vaccine development and therapeutics. For this reason, ISARIC (the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) was set up in advance. This focuses on hospitalised and convalescent serum samples to understand severe illness and associated immune response. However, many subjects are seroconverting with mild or even subclinical disease. Information is needed about subclinical infection, the significance of baseline immune status and the earliest immune changes that may occur in mild disease to compare with those of SARS-CoV-2. There is also a need to understand the vulnerability and response to COVID-19 of the NHS workforce of healthcare workers (HCWs). HCW present a cohort with likely higher exposure and seroconversion rates than the general population, but who can be followed up with potential for serial testing enabling an insight into early disease and markers of risk for disease severity. We have set up ""COVID-19: Healthcare worker Bioresource: Immune Protection and Pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2"". This urgent fieldwork aims to secure significant (n=400) sampling of healthcare workers (demographics, swabs, blood sampling) at baseline, and weekly whilst they are well and attending work, with acute sampling (if hospitalised, via ISARIC, if their admission hospital is part of the ISARIC network) and convalescent samples post illness. These will be used to address specific questions around the impact of baseline immune function, the earliest immune responses to infection, and the biology of those who get non-hospitalized disease for local research and as a national resource. The proposal links directly with other ongoing ISARIC and community COVID projects sampling in children and the older age population. Reasonable estimates suggest the usable window for baseline sampling of NHS HCW is closing fast (e.g. baseline sampling within 3 weeks). ***  *** Detailed Description *** The proposed study is a prospective observational cohort design which will be carried out across three different trusts: Barts Health NHS Trust (St Bartholomew's Hospital, The Royal London Hospital, Whipps Cross Hospital and Newham Hospital), Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (Royal Free Hospital) and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH).

Therefore this study should capture: - emergency surgery patients with clinical diagnosis or lab confirmation of COVID-19 infection before surgery. - emergency surgery patients with clinical diagnosis or lab confirmation of COVID-19 infection after surgery. - elective surgery patients with clinical diagnosis or lab confirmation of COVID-19 infection after surgery. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria should be included regardless of surgical indication (aneurysm, limb or visceral ischemia, carotid stenosis, vascular trauma), anaesthetic type (local, regional, general), procedure type, or surgical approach (open surgery, endovascular surgery, hybrid procedure). At most sites it is anticipated that the number of eligible patients is likely to be low. If possible all consecutive patients fulfilling inclusion criteria should be entered. Study period Overall we plan to close data entry in September 2020 when the global pandemic is likely to be over, however individual centres may select their own study windows, depending on the timing of COVID-19 epidemic in their community. Patient enrolment Ideally patients should be identified prospectively. However, given the rapid progression of the global pandemic, there may be no further new cases of COVID-19 infection in some hospitals that treated large numbers of COVID-19 earlier in the pandemic. It is important to capture the experience of these centres, therefore retrospective patient identification and data entry is permitted. Primary outcome - 30-day mortality Secondary outcome - 7-day mortality - 30-day reoperation - Postoperative ICU admission - Postoperative respiratory failure - Postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - Postoperative sepsis Data collection Data will be collected and stored online through a secure server running the Spanish Society for Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SEACV) web application. This secure server allows collaborators to enter and store data in a secure system. A designated collaborator at each participating site will be provided with a project server login details, allowing them to securely submit data on to the system. Only anonymised data will be uploaded to the database. No patient identifiable data will be collected. Data collected will be on comorbidities, physiological state, treatment/operation, and outcome. No dates (e.g. date of surgery) will be collected. qSOFA and CURB-65 will be calculated based on the individual data points entered. Local approvals The principal investigator at each participating site is responsible for obtaining necessary local approvals (e.g. research ethics committee or institutional review board approvals).The first approval will be on the Valladolid East Ethics Committee for Clinical Investigation. Collaborators will be required to confirm that a local approval is in place at the time of uploading each patient record to the study database. Where an audit approval is needed, this can be either registered as service evaluation, or to benchmark against an auditable standard (e.g. overall mortality after emergency surgery should be <15%). Prior to formal local study approval, collaborators may prospectively collect data, but this should not be uploaded to the database until approval is confirmed. Analysis A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written. Analyses will be overseen by the independent data monitoring committee (DMC). Reports will include description of the primary and secondary outcomes in the cohort. Multivariable modelling will be undertaken to CovidVAS protocol identify risk factors for 30-days mortality. Analyses will be stratified according to whether or not diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by a lab test. Interim analyses will be performed as guided by the independent DMC. The first analysis will be performed once 50 patients have been entered on to the database, and the frequency of subsequent analyses will be agreed with the DMC. The decision to submit data for publication will be agreed by the steering committee with the DMC. Hospital-level data will not be released or published. Authorship Collaborators from each site who contribute patients will be recognised on any resulting publications as PubMed-citable co-authors.",N/A

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 respiratory infection, appears to be very contagious however all the modes of transmission are unclear. Transmission may occur in up to 25 percent of cases when there are no symptoms (asymptomatic). Before there are any symptoms, droplet spray during speaking may increase transmission from person to person; most of the spray is saliva. Researchers at the NIH would like to test saliva for the virus before symptoms are reported. Additionally, they would like to examine the importance of using masks to prevent transmission. They hope to better understand how COVID-19 is spread among people and how it can be prevented. Objectives: To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is present in saliva in asymptomatic individuals who are COVID-19 positive. To determine if using masks can prevent transmission. Eligibility: People ages 18 and older without symptoms of COVID-19 who have been in close contact (e.g. live in the same house) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or NIH workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have mild or no symptoms. Retested individuals may be enrolled to understand how the disease has progressed and resolved. Design and Procedures: For screening, interested participants will contact a study team member. The interested participant will be asked to provide documentation of COVID-19 positive status, their symptoms, or their contact to a COVID-19 positive person. Participants will have weekly telephone calls to discuss their symptoms and 2-5 drive-up visits to the NIH within 28 days. At the drive-up facility, participants will participate in a speaking exercise with and without wearing a mask. The droplets they produce while they speak will be collected. Participants will spit into a cup and have saliva collected from different areas of the mouth. They should not eat 90 minutes before this but drinking water or juice is acceptable. They may have their tongue painted with a sour liquid to increase their saliva. Participants will have a swab rubbed inside their nose. For those who are close contacts and need a COVID-19 test, they will have a swab inserted through the nose to rub the back of their throat. Participants will complete questionnaires about their symptoms electronically at home. Subjects may be asked to return to the NIH more frequently by the study team based on testing results. If at any time the participants start to have moderate or severe respiratory symptoms, their participation will end and they should seek care with their local provider. ***  *** Detailed Description *** COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic without an effective therapy. A series of reports have implicated that asymptomatic transmission occurs in at least 25% SARS-CoV-2 cases. We hypothesize that droplet emission from oral fluids generated during speaking could be an important and actionable factor driving asymptomatic transmission. We aim to collect oral and nasal secretions to test for viral load and viral infectivity in 1) asymptomatic high-risk subjects with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status, but with a history of close personal contact with a SARSCoV- 2 positive person and 2) asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects who are SARS-CoV-2 positive. COVID-19 positive individuals re-testing as negative can be enrolled to complete the electronic questionnaire(s) assessment and allow for evaluation of history of symptoms.",N/A

This new kind of coronavirus is generating an unprecedented impact both on the general population and on the healthcare systems in most countries. Health services are trying to expand their capacity to respond to the pandemic, taking actions such as increasing the number of beds; acquiring necessary equipment to provide intensive therapy (ventilators), and calling retired health professionals and health students so they can assist the overwhelmed health care workforce. Unfortunately, these organizational changes at health facilities, along with the fears and concerns of becoming ill with the virus or infecting their families, put an enormous emotional burden on workers in health services which may lead to negative outcomes on mental health in this population. Based on the literature to date, Covid-19 is significantly larger than previous pandemics in terms of the number of affected people worldwide, its spread across countries, its impact on healthcare systems and the severity of measures that have been taken by governments. Immediate consequences are palpable in the health care system. Many healthcare workers are overwhelmed by the increased workload; the lack of supplies and materials to provide appropriate treatment; the lack of clinical guidelines on prioritization and triage; and the increased feelings of isolation and loneliness. Previous research indicates that these negative effects can last over time and lead to the development of serious mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Recent cross-sectional studies in China indicate that health service workers exposed to people with Covid-19 reported higher rates of depressive and anxious symptoms. This negative impact on mental health among health workers in China has also been informally reported in other countries where the Covid-19 pandemic has been devastating in its effects (such as Spain and Italy), as well as in countries where the pandemic is becoming a growing public health problem. This is particularly relevant in regions with fewer resources (Latin America, North Africa), where there are limited means and the response from the health system is usually insufficient. Moreover, it is necessary to study these negative effects longitudinally considering that some effects will appear over time (post-traumatic stress). Also, it is necessary to take into account the nature and the extent of the health response (e.g., deployment, increased workload) in order to advance our understanding of these complex phenomenon and to inform policy and develop the kind of supports that this population deems useful. Accordingly, this prospective (0, 3, 6 and 12 months), multisite cohort study aims to describe, examine, and evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health and psycho/social factors among workers at health services from Latin America and the Caribbean (Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Bolivia, and Puerto Rico), Europe and neighboring countries (Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Armenia, Poland, Macedonia, and Turkey), the Middle East and North Africa (Lebanon and Tunisia), as well as Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, Ghana) and Asia (China). Additionally, a team from the United States of America will also participate in this collaborative effort providing expertise on psychiatric epidemiology and supporting coordination across countries. Participants will complete an online questionnaire, which will be completely self-administered. It will take approximately 12 minutes and includes sociodemographic data, questions on work activity, training, fears and concerns related to Covid-19, as well as the GHQ-12 and a series of questions on other mental health issues (e.g., suicide, acute stress), resilience and psycho/social factors (e.g., formal and informal support).",N/A

This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.  *** In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of April 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus.  *** Groups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus. *** Hospitals are recognised to be a major risk for the spread of infections despite the availability of protective measures. Under normal circumstances, staff may acquire and transmit infections, but the health impact of within hospital infection is greatest in vulnerable patients. For the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, like recent outbreaks such as the SARS and Ebola virus, the risk of within hospital spread of infection presents an additional, significant health risk to healthcare workers. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams within hospitals engage in practices that minimise the number of infections acquired within hospital. This includes surveillance of infection spread, and proactively leading on training to clinical and other hospital teams. There is now good evidence that genome sequencing of epidemic viruses such as that which causes COVID-19, together with standard IPC, more effectively reduces within hospital infection rates and may help identify the routes of transmission, than just existing IPC practice. The aims of the study are to evaluate the benefit of genome sequencing in this context, and whether rapid (24-48 hour) turnaround on the data to IPC teams has an impact on that level of benefit.  ***  *** Who can participate? *** Inpatients who are COVID-19 positive and suspected of having been transmitted the virus from the hospital setting (where positive over 48 hours after admission) ***  *** What does the study involve? *** The study involves the use of genomic sequencing of COVID-19-positive patients in hospitals to inform Infection Prevention Control (IPC) measures undertaken within the hospital in the hopes of reducing hospital transmission of the virus. The study team will ask participating NHS hospitals to collect IPC information as per usual practice for a short time to establish data for comparison. Where patients are confirmed to have a COVID-19 infection thought to have been transmitted within hospital, their samples will be sequenced with data fed back to hospital teams during the intervention phase. A final phase without the intervention may take place for additional information on standard IPC practice when the COVID-19 outbreak is at a low level nationwide. ***  *** What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? *** Any participants in this study will already have confirmed COVID-19 infection. Therefore any benefits to these patients of the intervention will be indirect. The potential benefit to the participants will be dependent on the effectiveness of the intervention and their location within the hospital. In the event the intervention results in a lower level of nosocomial transmissions, it is likely that participants will benefit from lower numbers than otherwise of COVID-19 cases at the NHS site, and therefore more staffing resource on a per participant basis being available. The substantive overarching benefit of proven effectiveness for this study would be for patients generally within the hospital setting, and potentially the wider public. There are no anticipated risks to participation beyond having confirmed COVID-19 infection. ***  *** Where is the study run from?  *** University College London (UCL) ***  *** When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? *** March 2020 to April 2021 ***  *** Who is funding the study? *** COG-UK Consortium (UK) ***  *** Who is the main contact? *** Unfortunately, this study is not recruiting public volunteers at this time.

Although considerable overlap of these populations has been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100% redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP may provide benefit to these critically ill patients. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Coronavirus's are responsible for 15-30% of ""common colds"" and approximately 2% of the population may be healthy carriers of these viruses. The ongoing SARS CoV-2 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China and has spread worldwide. The disease caused by SARS CoV-2 (COVID19) is manifest by fever, fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis and headache. Although the majority (~80%) COVID19 cases are mild in severity, patients may present with moderate symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea (~15%) or more severe symptoms (~5-10%) of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, arrythmias and shock(6-9). In addition to the common clinical presentation of respiratory distress, an increasing frequency of cardiovascular manifestations have become evident. These manifestations may be linked to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS CoV-2, which is expressed predominantly in the heart, intestine, kidney and pulmonary alveolar (type 2) cells. Recent data suggest that ~20% of infected subjects may require hospitalization and among patients hospitalized for COVID19, 12-28% will have evidence of myocardial injury (elevated high-sensitivity Troponin: hsTPN) often in association with electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, arrythmias and/or evidence for impaired Left Ventricular contractile function on non-invasive imaging. Indeed, a syndrome of ""pseudo-infarction"" manifest as ST-segment elevation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease has been described. The etiology(s) of myocardial injury may be multifactorial and includes demand ischemia due to critical illness, cytokine storm with atherosclerotic plaque disruption due to overwhelming systemic inflammation and more likely, myocarditis. Indeed, SARS CoV viral RNA along with macrophage infiltration and myocardial cell injury has been detected in autopsied heart samples from patients who succumbed to the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Further, myocardial injury has been directly correlated with both the degree of systemic inflammation (Level of hsCRP) and cardiac dysfunction (level of NT-proBNP). Importantly, myocardial injury was identified to be one of the two most significant, independent predictors (by multi-variable analysis) of hospital death (in addition to ARDS) and provides increased prognostic information above and beyond that provided by pre-existing co-morbidities including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the incremental risk for death incurred by evidence of myocardial injury appears to be ~5-10x and is amplified by pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Thus, evidence of myocardial injury has evolved to be a significant (if not the most significant) predictor of mortality among patients admitted to hospital for care of COVID19 disease. It is important to recognize that this elevated morality risk has been identified despite modern and aggressive intensive care therapies including mechanical ventilation, pressor/inotrope therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In this context, the investigators propose to evaluate intravenous administration of convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring hospitalization for symptomatic ""high risk"" COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illness.

This is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label treatment of eligible subjects defined as those who satisfy all inclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will provide written, informed consent prior to participation. A pregnancy test will be obtained on all women of child-bearing potential. Following informed consent, the following baseline laboratory tests will be obtained: - Hs-CRP - D-Dimer - NT-pro BNP These laboratory tests which reflect inflammation, thrombosis and myocardial dysfunction (in addition hsTPN which reflects myocardial necrosis) will be repeated every 2 days during hospitalization. Following baseline assessments and informed consent, eligible enrollees will receive convalescent CoVID-19 plasma by intravenous infusion. COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Study: Convalescent plasma will be obtained from male donors, nulliparous females, or female donors negative for HLA antibodies at least 28 days following recovery from COVID-19 infection. These donors are used to minimize the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Routine ABO and Rh typing and red cell antibody screening will be performed.

The aim of our study will therefore be to assess the impact of long-term protease inhibitors in PLWHIV on the incidence of COVID-19. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The symptomatic management of COVID-19 infections is currently at the forefront. The therapeutic efficacy of certain molecules is being evaluated in studies, in vitro and in vivo, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine / chloroquine, and lopinavir / ritonavir. The latter has been used in the treatment of HIV for many years, like other PIs such as darunavir and atazanavir. In France, around 11% of PLWHIV are treated with long-term PIs. Lopinavir / ritonavir has an inhibitory role on the protein endopeptidase of coronavirus C30 (CEP_C30). In humans, Cao et al did not demonstrate any superiority of efficacy of lopinavir / ritonavir compared to the control group receiving standard care (HR for clinical improvement: 1.24 (0.90-1, 72)), but the initiation of treatment in the study was mainly at late stages. Early initiation of lopinavir/r at the onset of SARS symptoms appears to be more effective. To our knowledge, the other PIs are under study, with a possible inhibition of the proteases of type-3-chemotrypsin or of the papain type of SARS-Cov2. Three open randomized studies in humans are underway in China, Spain, and Thailand. The question arises as to whether treatment with PIs could have a preventive role for COVID-19 infection, especially since PLWHIV have not been described as more at risk of developing COVID-19 infection.

It soon became evident that COVID-19 had multi-system effects at it's worst. In orthopaedics one of the most vulnerable groups to COVID-19 were the elderly, specifically those who suffered fractured neck of femur at this time.

COVID is associated with severe morbidity and an estimated mortality of 2-4% in patients without comorbidity. According to a WHO report published on the situation in China, patients with serious chronic pathologies, such as diabetes or severe obesity, are particularly vulnerable and mortality rates were higher: from 7 to 13%. Monitoring and describing the clinical pathway of out-patients suspected of being infected according to their medical history should improve knowledge of COVID, and then adapt patient care management and control the COVID pandemic. Currently, few European studies have described the potential risk factors that could lead to the worsening of the disease. Since the March 16th, the university hospital of Grenoble (France) has developed an information technology system to monitor out-patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and with early home monitoring: the COVIDADOM cohort That's why the COVIDADOMEVA study is then to identify the risk factors aggravating the COVID, in out-patients with precocious home monitoring.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody assessment provides a tool to evaluate antibody prevalence in hospital staff identifying previously exposed individuals. Serologic testing could identify new cases of COVID-19 in an early fashion and could help to investigate cases of reactivation or reinfection in hospital workers. The study purpose is to conduct a study using serological screening for health care workers in a University Hospital in Buenos Aires in order to assess the risk of COVID-19 on those who have not developed an immune response against the virus, or to detect it in an early fashion (either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic). If a study participant is suspected to have potential reinfection or reactivation of COVID-19, the investigators will conduct genome sequencing in order to be able to differentiate each case. The investigators will include 50 participants chosen at random among health care workers from the hospital Emergency Department (ED), Internal Medicine wards, or Critical Care Units who are exposed to COVID-19. Participants who agree to join the study and sign the informed consent form will be screened at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, along with a physical exam and basic laboratory determinations.

This phenomenon, called immune memory, helps our bodies avoid reinfection by a bug persons have had before and influences the potency of life-saving treatments and vaccines. Also, the new coronavirus causes cardiac and pulmonary inflammation. So, our study planned to measure the cardiopulmonary and immunological changes in treated COVID-19 patients. Specific objectives: Measurement the duration of existence of COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibody in patient's plasma, detection of cardiac changes, pulmonary radiological and functional changes after COVID-19 infection. This could help detection of functional impairment in COVID-19 survivors which may have economic and social impact. Also, investigator will assess possible protective immune response following infection which may affect vaccination schedule. Methods: One hundred RT- PCR positive COVID-19 patients will be enrolled. HRCT chest, lateral flow immunoassay, spirometry, DLCO and Echo will be done on after 3, 6 and 12 months of discharge. ***  *** Detailed Description *** • Background and significance: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. Radiological, lung function changes were reported in different studies of pulmonary viral infection. After a patient has recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), CT shows transient interlobular septal thickening and reticulation over a course of several weeks to months. The reticulation appears after the 2nd week and peaks around the 4th week. One-third of patients with persistent respiratory symptoms will have imaging findings of fibrosis, including interlobular and intralobular reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and, rarely, honeycombing. Areas of air trapping, caused by damage to ciliated respiratory epithelium, have been reported in 92% of patients who have recovered from pneumonia and are less likely to resolve completely. Likewise, in patients with MERS, although the majority fully recover, 33% show evidence of lung fibrosis on follow-up imaging. These patients were commonly older, had prolonged ICU admission, and had greater lung involvement in the acute phase of the disease. CT was performed 1 year after MERS-CoV infection in 65 (89%) patients. Radiological sequelae were revealed in 25% (4/16), 63% (19/30), and 95% (18/19) of patients in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The median radiological sequelae score was 0, 1, and 3 in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia groups, respectively, and the radiological sequelae scores were significantly correlated with the severity of pneumonia (P < 0.001). The finding that more severe MERS pneumonia resulted in more impaired lung function strongly suggests that pulmonary sequelae can remain at least 1 year after MERS-CoV pneumonia, which is also supported by the correlation of radiological sequela correlated with the severity of MERS pneumonia. A previous study showed that 24% of SARS survivors have impaired DLCO and 5% reduced lung volume at 12 months. A follow-up study of 55 patients with SARS at 24 months revealed that 10 (18.2%), 9 (16.4%), 6 (10.9%) and 29 (52.7%) subjects had FEV1, FVC, TLC and DL(CO) < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The mean (SD) 6MWD increased significantly from 439.0 (89.1) m at 3 months to 460.1 (102.8) m at 6 months (P 0.016) and became steady after 6 months. However, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey scores were lower than the normal population throughout the study. Pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome patients 3 months after hospital discharge, but the impairment was mild in almost all cases. Many patients had reduced exercise capacity that cannot be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function. The deleterious SARS‐CoV‐2 infection myocardial effects could also be perpetuated by the prompt and severe downregulation of myocardial and pulmonary ACE2 pathways, thereby mediating myocardial inflammation, lung edema, and acute respiratory failure. ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also in the cardiovascular system and, therefore, ACE2‐related signalling pathways might even have a role in heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and 2 T‐helper cells strong interferon‐mediated immunopathological events and respiratory dysfunction and hypoxemia caused by COVID‐19, resulting in damage to myocardial cells. Infection due to viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens initiates complex systemic inflammatory responses as part of innate immunity. Activation of host defense systems results in subsequent activation of coagulation and thrombin generation as critical communication components among humoral and cellular amplification pathways, a term called thromboinflammation or immunothrombosis. Several serological immunoassays have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and antibodies in the serum or plasma. The most widely used biomarkers for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in commercial immunoassays are IgM and IgG antibodies produced in suspects from the 2nd week of viral infection. IgM can be detected in the patient samples from 10 to 30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while IgG can be detected from 20 days onwards. The IgM response occurs earlier than that of IgG, but it then decreases and disappears. On the other hand, IgG can persist after infection for a long time and may have a protective role. A study reported that ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with an RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 RT-PCR positive individuals tested ≥10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. • Timeliness, innovative nature and relevance of the project AS COVID -19 is an emerging pandemic since late 2019, follow up studies of its sequelae are still lacking. The aim is to track any consequences regarding radiological findings, functional impairment of respiratory system and immunological response to COVID -19. This may have an economic and social burden if lung functions are deteriorating post infection. Also, development of an effective vaccination is an issue of great interest all over the world. Existence and duration of persistence of protective antibodies may help prediction of vaccination frequency and better understanding of the nature of the virus. • Research design and methodologies: One hundred RT- PCR positive COVID-19 patients will be enrolled. The following data will be collected: - Medical history: age, sex, occupation, comorbidities, previous treatment, … - Clinical classification of COVID-19 infection: 1- Mild: clinical symptoms without pneumonia 2- Moderate: clinical symptoms with pneumonia 3- Severe: who meet any of the following: respiratory rate 30 breath\minute, oxygen saturation less than 93% at rest and patient with more than 50%lesion progression within 24 to 48h in the lung - Radiological data: Pulmonary CT pattern of COVID-19 using Philips Ingenuity core 128 the Netherlands: 1. COVID-19 pneumonia, Type L: Only ground-glass densities are present on CT scan, primarily located subpleural and along the lung fissures. Consequently, lung weight is only moderately increased. 2. COVID-19 pneumonia, Type H: The increased amount of non-aerated tissue Follow up CT at 3, 6 and 12 months intervals Echocardiography using Sonoscape A5 portable echocardigraph: 3, 6 and 12 months intervals after clinical improvement • Pulmonary function test: Spirometry: measurement of lung volumes and capacities (forced expiratory volume in first second FEV1, forced vital capacity FVC, FEV1\FVC and FEF25\75) Diffusion capacity of the lung to carbon monoxide (DLCO) at 3, 6 and 12 months intervals after clinical improvement • Immunological data: Detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibody in patient's plasma During infection and at 3, 6 and 12 months intervals after clinical improvement by BIOCREDIT COVID-19 IgG+ IgM Duo (One Step SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Antibody Rapid Test) RapiGEN.INC. BIOCREDIT COVID-19 IgG+ IgM Duo is a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of IgG and IgM specific to SARS-COV-2 virus in human serum, plasma and whole blood. Antihuman IgG and IgM conjugated with colloidal gold particles will react specifically with the SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in patient's serum, plasma and whole blood. The colloidal gold conjugated anti-human IgG & IgM and SARS-COV-2 specific IgG & IgM forms antibody-antibody-gold particle complex then it moves to pre-coated SARS-COV-2 NP and Spike protein recombinant antigens on the membrane. The reaction forms antigen-antibody-antibody-gold particle complex then they show as color band at T- line area. The control line (C) is used for procedural control and should always appear if the test is performed correctly. • Detailed time plan On discharge from hospital 1 month post discharge 3 months post discharge 6 months post discharge 12 months post discharge CT angiographychest 1,3,6,12 months Lateral flow immunoassay 1,3,6,12 months Spirometry 1,3,6,12 months DLCO 1,3,6,12 months Echo 1,3,6,12 months • Quality of the research team Research team members are quick thinker, eager to know more and more, have analytical mind, show Commitment, cooperative and have excellent written and verbal communication skills.

Beginning on March 16th, 2020 Northwell Health postponed all elective surgeries. As the incidence of COVID-19 cases begins to decrease and hospital volume improves we need to ensure the safety of our patients planning surgical procedures. However, at this time there is a scarcity of data regarding the COVID-19 test conversion rate in surgical patients. Our goal is to determine the COVID-19 test conversion rate in these patients to better guide strategies for restarting surgical care in a large-scale pandemic. Patients will be routinely tested with serology and PCR for COVID-19 24-48 hours prior to their scheduled surgery. Those who provide informed consent will be re-tested 12-16 days after discharge from the hospital to determine any potential nosocomial infection rate. Patients will also answer a few questions during their retest to allow the study team to gauge exposure risk postoperatively after leaving the hospital. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The rapid spread of the COVID-19 infection has led to a near global lockdown including a pause in all elective surgeries [1-6]. Multiple healthcare systems and surgical societies recommended ceasing all elective procedures until this crisis is contained [7-10]. As such, it will be necessary for hospitals to restructure as surgeries increase to protect surgical patients from becoming infected. Our study will be the first to define the test conversion rate of those undergoing surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information gathered from this study can have implications in how surgical centers treat patients during and after this pandemic. There has been a single study examining postoperative nosocomial infections during the initial incubation period in which 100% of patients developed Sars-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, 14 (44%) required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation, and 7 (20.5%) died after ICU admission [11]. A second cohort of bariatric surgery patients found that 4 of 4 (100%) developed Sars-CoV-2 infections postoperatively with all patients surviving [12]. Another retrospective study found that of 305 patients admitted to the digestive surgery service, 15 (4.9%) developed nosocomial Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia [13]. Of this cohort, two patients died, and seven were hospitalized with six discharged at the time of chart review. Another retrospective non-operative hospital cohort found that 34 of 102 adult patients contracted Sars-CoV-2 as a nosocomial infection. In a review of Gynecologic Oncology procedures in Wuhan the overall nosocomial infection rate was 1.59% (3/189) with two of the three patients being discharged by the publication date [14]. However, in a retrospective review of a general hospital ward in Hong Kong in which the staff used 'vigilant basic infection control measures' 10 patients and 7 staff members that met the definition for close contact were identified and through contact tracing 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts with no Sars-CoV-2 infections identified [15]. Another cohort from Wuhan demonstrated that when performing regional anesthesia (45/49 for Cesarean Section), no anesthetists were infected when complying with level 3 PPE [16]. 1.

Early data suggest that most patients with severe COVID-19 (i.e., experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF) in an intensive care unit) may have cytokine release syndrome and other major effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, there is limited understanding of both the inflammatory/immunological and the clinical course of COVID-19, with no robust data published beyond hospital discharge. Based on prior literature from acute viral illnesses, such as Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), persistent functional impairments in COVID-19 survivors is expected. Despite the importance of these issues, very few studies have ever investigated the biological mechanisms underlying persistent functional impairments after ARF. Hence, understanding the short- and longer-term biological and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and investigating associations between inflammation and clinical outcomes is important to design acute therapies and recovery-focused interventions. To address critical gaps in knowledge, the investigators propose a 2-center longitudinal cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients via an Administrative Supplement to our existing grant (R01HL132887, MPIs Stapleton and Needham). Investigators will study COVID-19 patients with ARF who have either severe disease (requiring mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, or high flow nasal cannula oxygen support) or non-severe disease (new or increased supplemental oxygen requirement, without meeting severe criteria). Researchers will perform an in-depth evaluation of inflammatory/immunological, physical, pulmonary, and neuropsychological status during hospitalization, and over 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up. Feasibility for accomplishing this prospective study is demonstrated by 1) a successful existing collaboration between the University of Vermont (UVM) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), supported by multiple NIH grants, and 2) the current and projected COVID-19 census at both hospital systems. The investigators have the existing infrastructure, expertise, and personnel to enroll 225 patients with COVID-19, and longitudinally follow survivors for 12 months, to investigate short-term and longer-term inflammatory/immunologic and clinical outcomes during this pandemic.",N/A

At the DCC platform, there will be assessments of cardiovascular symptoms, Covid-19 prevention for cardiovascular patients, smoking cessation, anxiety relief, exercise stimulation, pulmonary rehabilitation and diet adjustments. This will be done by means of questionnaires and E-consults. Investigators start this project now because of two reasons. First, the prolonged waiting list due to the Covid pandemic creates the opportunity to use this period for cardiac prehabilitation. Second, it is only recently that the investigators got the possibility to use a digital platform, which is ideal in this period of social distancing. Objective: Primary Objective: - What is the effect of an interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling platform with E-consulting on cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year after the cardiac surgery compared to the control condition (no interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling)? Secondary Objective(s): - What is the effect of an interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling platform with E-consulting on patient-measured outcomes during treatment delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic measured just before, and 1 year after the cardiac surgery compared to the control condition (no interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling)? Study design: Randomized controlled trial. The investigators will use random permuted block size if technically feasible otherwise with random block sizes of 4, 6, and 8. The randomization will be computer-based and will generate two groups. Both groups will get access to the Digital Cardiac Counseling platform and both groups will complete the same set of validated questionnaires at the same time intervals. The intervention groups will get additional training modules and E-consulting based on the risk assessment retrieved from the completed questionnaires. Study population: The patient population will include any adult patient on the waiting list for any elective cardiovascular operation in MUMC during Covid-19 pandemic. Intervention: the intervention group will receive through the Digital Cardiac Counselling platform different modules with E-counselling for risk factors evaluated in the questionnaires.The digital counselling modules for intervention group are described below: - - Screening for reduced physical fitness. If there are signs for a decreased physical condition we will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with our physiotherapist. The patients then get access to a digital module with information and videos of physical exercise training. The patient gets a trainings schedule and the investigators will contact the patient after about 1 and 3 weeks to check their progression and to give additional advice when needed. - Screening for smoking. If the patient smokes and is motivated to quit smoking, the investigators will refer, after consultation, for a digital intake with one of our stop smoking nurses. Then, a digital and telephone supported counselling will start after an informed and shared decision making with the nurse. When needed, supportive medication can be prescribed. - Screening for malnutrition and obesity. If there are signs of malnutrition (MUST-score) or obesity (BMI >30) the investigators will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with a dietician. The patients then get access to a digital module with information about a healthy diet. The investigators will contact the patient ever 2 weeks in case of malnutrition and every 4 weeks in case of obesity. In the case of malnutrition the dietician can prescribe protein rich nutrition supplements when needed. - Screening for anxiety and depression. If there are signs for anxiety and depression, the investigators will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with a psychological assistant. The patients then get access to a digital platform with information and exercises. The psychological assistant will guide the patient and will provide digital support after 1 and 3 weeks. - Screening for elevated pulmonary risk score. When patients have an elevated risk score for adverse pulmonary complications (pulmonary risk score for cardiac surgery patients questionnaire) the investigators will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with our physiotherapist. The patients then get access to a digital module with information and videos of pulmonary exercise training. The investigators will send a inspiratory muscle trainer (IMT) to the patient to perform daily exercises. The patient gets a trainings schedule and the investigators will contact the patient after about 1 and 3 weeks to check their progression and to give additional advice when needed. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is cumulative incidence of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events) at 1 year after cardiac surgery. The primary outcome is the difference in percentage of patients that experienced Mace at 1-year follow-up postoperatively. The investigators expect that approximately 20% of patients in the control group will experience an event. The investigators will include 197 patients per group, or 394 in total, to be able to have 80% power to detect a difference in MACE of 10% between groups in favor of the intervention group, using an alpha of 0.05.",N/A

The severity of the disease varies widely with evidence of mild disease in the majority of confirmed cases, severe pneumonia-dyspnea, hypoxia or lung involvement at imaging within 24-48 hours- and critical disease with respiratory failure, shock or multi-organ failure in particular patient cohorts. Imaging plays a key role is diagnosis and progression of this disease. ***  *** Detailed Description *** In March 2020, the third highest number of positive cases in the world was recorded in Italy, mainly due to 2 outbreaks of 2 different clusters in Lombardy and Veneto. Fever is the most common symptom, followed by fatigue and dry cough; worsening of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome are found in severe cases. Previous reports have highlighted the key role of chest computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) in the diagnosis and follow-up of CoViD-19. The most frequent clinical manifestation seems to be viral pneumonia, characterised by fever, cough, dyspnea. The severity of the disease varies widely: with evidence of mild disease in the majority of confirmed cases, severe pneumonia on a part of these, defined as dyspnea, hypoxia or lung involvement > 40% at imaging within 24-48 hours, and critical disease defined as respiratory failure, shock or multi-organ failure in particular patient cohorts.The mortality rate between cases ranges from approximately 4% in early reports to 14%, depending on the intensity of transmission and time of infection, and most fatal cases occurred in older patients or in patients with pre-existing medical co-morbidities. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and follow-up of this infection.Several studies have been published describing the results of imaging, mainly using chest CT (computed tomography) with a limited number of articles describing disease in European patients or the possible different clinical/radiological presentation of the disease in European patients. Pulmonary pathological findings appear to be similar to those previously described in SARS and MERS, with a prevalence of frosted glass densities and occasional consolidation.According to the literature, the 3 main features for the diagnosis of CoVid-19 pneumonia are: alveolar disease, represented by ground glass densities, bilateral distribution and prevalent peripheral involvement. This triad is more common in intermediate stages of the disease. In the early stages of the disease, a significant proportion of patients may present with negative or dubious X-rays and CT scans.There is an important overlap with imaging findings of other viral pneumonia, in particular with other members of the coronaviridae family: consolidation, however, seems to be less common in the early stages of CoViD-19 and bilateral distribution is less frequent in SARS and MERS pneumonia. Very little data have been published on the radiological evolution and modification of radiological aspects during infection: as the disease progresses, parenchymal consolidations begin to resorb and assume a frosted glass appearance. Another possible evolution is the progression towards the radiological aspect of the ""white lung"". This study aims to describe imaging aspects of CoViD-19 infection in Italian patients and the data on the radiological evolution.",N/A

Low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) could possibly reduce the inflammation and prevent the cytokine storm thus mitigating the severity of pneumonitis. This is a single arm study designed to assess the feasibility and clinical efficacy of low dose radiation therapy (70 cGy in single fraction) in the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A total of 10 eligible patients (as per inclusion criteria) will be recruited and response will be assessed based on the symptomatic improvement or deterioration by using the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). The NEWS score will be recorded on baseline and then on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14. ***  *** Detailed Description *** There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. The treatment is symptomatic, and oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention for patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen therapy, whereas hemodynamic support is essential for managing septic shock. The death rate ranges from 2-15% in different group of patients. COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in modern history of humankind and it has become imperative to find novel treatments to mitigate the casualties caused by infection. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from mild symptoms to critical conditions requiring ventilatory support and ICU care. According to Chinese CDC report, 81% patients had mild disease (non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia), 14% had severe disease and 5% had critical disease. Based on severity of symptoms, there are several scoring methods which can predict the outcome of disease. National early warning score (NEWS) is a popular scoring system used for non-ICU patients suffering from acute illness. This score helps in quickly determining the degree of illness and intervention required. It also provides likelihood of death or admission to an ICU. Based on this score any illness can be categorized as mild (Score <4), moderate (Score 5-6 or individual 3) and severe (Score ≥7). According to this scoring system, Covid-19 patients having a score of 5-6 will have probability of 15.7% critical events (HDU/ICU admission or 30-day mortality) and those having score ≥7 will have about 24.1% critical events. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonitis appears to involve a cytokine storm with elevated pro- inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα among many others, leading to an onslaught of neutrophils and macrophages, diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure. This is where a potential opportunity for low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) emerges. LDRT is a potential treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia since it has an anti-inflammatory action. Successful management of worsening pneumonia will reduce the development of ARDS and thereby preventing deaths. Availability of megavoltage beam in modern times has improved our dosimetry in treating deep targets. Radiotherapy which can penetrate lobar and interstitial space can help in preventing both lobar as well as interstitial pneumonia. In the absence of any effective drug and, historical data suggests that low dose of 0.5 to 1 Gy radiotherapy to whole lung can possibly prevent cytokine storm and critical events (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death). The initial use of X-rays to treat patients with pneumonia was reported in 1907. This report offered a new mechanistic insight founded on the dose response, proposing that low doses of X-rays would affect disease resolution. It was observed that not only did the X-ray treatment has lifesaving potential, but it was also effective when other treatments had reached their therapeutic limits as seen in cases of chronic bronchopneumonia, which could be resolved with a single administration of X-rays. Subsequent reports suggested that LDRT was successful in decreasing the mortality rate in untreated patients from about 30% to 5-10%. Rationale for the Study: It is reasonable to try an LDRT treatment of 30 to 100 cGy to the lungs of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia as it could reduce the inflammation and relieve the life-threatening symptoms. The recent emerging literature indicates that the efficacy of thoracic LDRT must be investigated as it would present a negligible risk to COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and have the potential to reduce the fatality rates. Study Design: Interventional, Clinical, Single arm, Pilot study Number of patients: 10 Treatment: Patient will be treated as per COVID-19 standard management protocol of the treating institute along with intervention of Low Dose Radiotherapy (LDRT) 70cGy in single fraction. Treatment field- Field adequately covering both the lungs. Beam energy : 6MV X-ray photons Number of beams- 2 (1 Anterior and 1 posterior field). Prescription point - Midway of anterior-posterior chest separation. Treatment Workflow: Patients will be maneuvered to lie down on treatment couch in a supine position, with hands above head. Gantry rotated to 90 degree, a lateral chest X ray portal image will be taken, which will guide in measuring dose prescription point. Gantry rotated back to 0 degree; an adequate field size will be opened. Total treatment duration will be about 20-30 minutes. Response Assessment and statistical analysis: Response will be assessed based on the symptomatic improvement or deterioration by using the NEWS score. The NEWS score will be recorded on baseline and then on Day 3 (D-3), Day 7 (D-7) and Day 14 (D-14). To compare the NEWS score (baseline and post LDRT), student t test (paired) will be used. For statistical significance, p value of 0.1 will be considered significant. Number of patients requiring ICU admission or undergoing death following LDRT will also be recorded to assess critical events.",N/A

In early 2020 novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) begun to spread from Asia to Europe and beyond forcing WHO to declare global pandemic. Infected patients shed the virus for a median of 20 days. Up to 10% of COVID-19 infected patients develop a severe form of disease requiring intensive care admission and some of them die. SARS-Cov2 is encapsulated positive strand RNA virus that uses ACE-2 of type 2 pneumocytes as binding sites. It has been hypothesised (Gattinoni 2020 ICM editorial) that initial hypoxemia caused by loss of primary injury to pulmonary vasculature leads to hyperventilation and patients self-inflicted lung injury predominantly in lung areas of increase stress and strain. In turn, later during the course of the disease, ARDS develops with a typical restrictive pattern of a stiff, wet and recruitable lung. At presents there is no evidence-based causative treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and there is a burning need of randomised-controlled trials to find effective therapeutic strategies intervention. Explanation of rationale: Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyrias. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 known to be susceptible in vitro to exposure to Hydrochloroquine. At the moment clinical trials are ongoing to test clinical efficacy in pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis in SARS-CoV-2. In one highly cited French non-randomised observational study by Gautret et. al., a significant reduction of virus carriage has been observed in patients co-incidentally treated by Azithromycin in addition to Hydrochloroquine as a part of initial empirical therapy of community-acquired pneumonia. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, which binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as positive-sense can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins and the effects of Azithromycin on this process are not known. No data are available at present on the clinical efficacy of Hydrochloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin and it is likely that any treatment affecting virus replication would only be effective if administered early, before overt ARDS develops. In the light of this, the investigators designed a trial in which a hypothesis is tested, that early administation of hydrochlorochine alone or in combination with azithromycin can prevent respiratory deterioration in patients admitted to intensive care due to rapidly progressive COVID-19 infection. Methods Trial design: Prospective, multi-centre, randomised, pragmatic, double blind trial Participants: Eligibility criteria for participants: Adult (>18 years) within 24 hours of admission to intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 infection. For the purpose of this study, intensive care unit is defined as a facility that allow continuous monitoring of vital functions and oxygen administration . It is expected that most patients will have rtPCR test known within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Nonetheless, if this is not the case (eg. due to overloaded lab facility, lack of supplies) it is possible to randomise a patient based on a strong clinical suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In case COVID-19 is not confirmed in retrospect, experimental therapy is withdrawn and the study subject is withdrawn from ""per protocol"" analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes, but remains in ""intention-to-treat"" cohort for the analysis of safety. Exclusion criteria: symptoms of febrile disease for ≥1 week, pregnancy, treatment limitations in place or moribund patients, allergy or intolerance of any study treatment, incl. long QT syndromes, myasthenia gravis, allergies or known deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, participation in another outcome-based interventional trial within last 30 days, patients taking Hydrochloroquine for other indication than COVID-19. Settings and locations: Central study site is FNKV University Hospital Prague, updated list of participating centres is listed in the appendix. Interventions: Standard of care. All patients will receive best supportive care that will be monitored, but not protocolised. It is recognised that in the standard of care may substantially differ among study centres and that is why randomisation is stratified. The standard of care also may change in time during the course of the study, for example, if a new evidence emerges and changes the state-of-the art treatment recommendations. Any such event will trigger emergency steering committee meeting, and decision will be taken about further action. REB and regulatory authorities will be notified immediately about the decision taken. Study medication: All study medication is provided as a kind gift of Zentiva, ltd. Unblinded study pharmacist will prepare into 40 mls of sterile water study medication, according to patient's allocation into the treatment arm: - Hydrochloroquine sulphate 200mg - Azithromycin dihydrate 500mg - Lactose 500mg (Placebo) See enclosed Specifications of Product characteristics. The medication will be administered in covered Jeannete syringe into nasogastric tube (for patients unable to swallowed) or drunk from a black mug by patients who are able to. In both cases at least 50 ml of water will be used for flush. Treatment group allocation is as follows: STUDY GROUP HC-A Azithromycin Hydrochloroquine HC Lactose Hydrochloroquine C Lactose Lactose Each study patient will be given: - Day 1: Patients receive two doses 400 mg of Hydrochloroquine or placebo in 12 hours interval and 500 mg of Azithromycin or placebo once in 24 hours (with the first dose of hydrochloroquine or placebo) - Days 2-5: Patients receive two doses 200 mg of Hydrochloroquine or placebo in 12 hours interval 250 mg of Azithromycin or placebo once in 24 hours (with the first dose of hydrochloroquine or placebo) Adjusting IP administration to patients' swallowing capability and GI function: During the study, 3 groups of patients will be enrolled. Those conscious and able to swallow will be given study medication in black mug to swallow. Patients unable to swallow with a nasogastric tube in place will be given the IP via the NG tube reconstituted in sterile water and flushed as per local NG medication guideline. Administration of the IP is temporarily omitted in patients who are unable to swallow but without NG access or do not tolerate any enteral intake (such as patients in profound shock). As soon as the condition preventing IP administration is eliminated, resumption of study medication follows the guidance for day 1. Outcomes: Primary outcome: Composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14. Secondary outcomes: Composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14 in the subgroup of patients without the need of mechanical ventilation at baseline. ICU-LOS D28 and D 90 mortality Tertiary (exploratory) outcomes: Viral load at D7 (No of viral RNA copies/ml of blood), proportion of patients alive and rtPCR negative from nasal swab at D14, Difference of FiO2 ratio and respiratory system compliance between day 0 and 7. Changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons: None at presents Sample size calculation: Based on data from Wuhan and Washington, where 67% of patients were dead in 2 weeks and half of the survivors needed protracted mechanical ventilation, the assumed incidence of the primary outcome in the control group (ie. being alive and off the ventilator in 2 weeks) to be 25%. The study gives us 80% chance to detect the increase of the primary outcome to 50% in one or both interventional groups at p<0.017 with 74 patients in each arm. In order to compensate for drop-out and low of follow up the plan is to enrol 240 subjects into the study. An interim analysis is planned after the primary outcome is known for the 120th subject. Randomisation: Will be performed in blocks of 3 and stratified for study centre and age (above or at/below 70 years). Electronic Case Record Form (eCRF) will perform randomisation using random sequence script in software R and generates medication code. Rationale: Patient's age is single most powerful predictor of outcome and stratifying randomisation and stratification decreases probability of treatment groups being of different age at baseline by chance. In analogy, study centers may vary in the use of non-protocolised treatments, which could bias the results. Implementation: Prior to initiation of each centre, the central research coordinator will train the local dedicated study personnel in the use of e-CRF and other study procedures. The medication will be delivered in sealed numbered boxes and stored in ICUs. Adhering to Good Clinical Practice rules and guidelines is of upmost importance despite all the challenges during current pandemic situation. Nonetheless, the eCRF has been designed to balance the safe conduct of the clinical trial and feasibility of timely data entry during staff shortages and overload. In order to do so, all data that is not essential for safety can be input in retrospect. Collection data on cointerventions. Data on interventions that the investigators know/think influence survival will be monitored and described. This include concomitant antiviral antimicrobial diagnosis. Data will also be collected on how the respiratory specimen for rtPCR diagnostic was collected (smear, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage). Statistical methods: Proportion of patients alive and off mechanical ventilation (primary outcome) between intervention and control groups will be calculated using chi square test. P-value is adjusted for multiple comparisons to p=0.017. Survival and ICU/length of stay will be compared using Kaplan-Maier's curves and exploratory analyses my multi-level regression in R. The plan is to analyse the primary outcome separately in patients who require mechanical ventilation at baseline from those who don't and in patients above or below 70 years of age as a priori subgroup analyses. As mentioned above, primary and secondary outcomes will only be calculated in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who received at least one dose of IP. Adverse events will be calculated in all randomised patients (intention-to-treat analysis). Ethical Considerations Benefits and risks. This trial investigates two drugs that are being used off label to treat patients with severe COVID-19 with a balance of potential benefits and harms. Potential benefit include good biological rationale and observational data to believe that one or both drugs can prevent progression of a disease which led to death in 67% of patients in similar condition to those in this study. Possible harms include QT prolongation and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias or retinopathy, which may result in blindness. The investigators believe that clinical equipoise regarding risk/benefit to individual patient justifies well the conduct of this RCT. Informed consent procedure. Patients with decision-making capacity will be asked to provide written prospective informed consent (See Appendix I) to this protocol. It is expected that a significant proportion of screened patients will lack the capacity to provide informed consent due to altered consciousness, respiratory distress or sedation to facilitate mechanical ventilation. In this situation, the deferred consent policy will be applied as per local law: independent physician will confirm in writing that the patient lacks capacity and fulfils criteria. Then, patient himself/herself are approached to provide consent as soon as they regain capacity. They are given options to continue in the study, to withdraw with permission to use the data collected up to the point or to withdraw from the study and request deleting all data collected. Patient next of kin plays no formal role as surrogate decision maker as per Czech legislature. Nonetheless, the family will be informed when practical about their relative's enrolment into the trial and the family will be offered an information leaflet explaining the nature of the study. All serious adverse event that are suspected from being related to study interventions will be reposted to Research Ethics Board and regulatory authorities as per local legislation. Stopping rules. All SUSARs will be reported to both REB and to the steering committee, who may decide to stop the trial for safety concerns. Apart from safety, other reasons for stopping the trial are: 1. Emergence of new data ( e.g. publication of the results of a big RCT) that may lead continuation of the trial unethical. This may be due to safety concerns of placebo group (in case strong clinical benefit is proven by other trial) or any of the interventional groups (e.g. if harm is reported by other trials). This rule also applies for emergence of a new treatment. 2. After interim analysis: The steering committee will review primary outcomes and the summary of adverse events in all 3 groups (labelled as A, B, C) whilst still blinded to treatment allocation. The treatment can be stopped if the following criteria are fulfilled: 1. There is a significant difference in the primary outcome at p<0.017 in between the groups. 2. Futility: The futility criterion is not binding for the steering committee. Based on available data the study statistician calculates the probability of being able to prove the null hypothesis with achieving the target number of subjects and the probability of type II error made by stopping the trial prematurely. 3. Safety: In case the number of adverse events in one or more treatment groups is find uneven or unacceptably high. Replication of key aspects of trial methods and conduct. The trial is designed to be fully reproducible in larger international multi-centre trial. Role of the sponsors This is investigator-initiated trial endorsed by Czech Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care. The most significant resource for the study is unpaid voluntary work of all the personnel conducting the study, who decided to do so in times of worldwide pandemic crisis. Part of the resources were gathered from voluntary donors in a crowdfunding campaign conducted by medical student association. Pharmaceutical company Zentiva, ltd. was approached by investigators and kindly agreed to provide study medication at no cost; however, it has had nor will have any role in study design; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or the decision to submit the report for publication. Dissemination of Results: The investigators will submit the main results of the trial in an open-access peer-reviewed journal within 3 months after 240th subject completed the 90-day follow up visit, which is expected to happen in Q4 of 2021. The investigators will make fully de-identified record-level raw data available in a public database. Trial status: NOT YET RECRUITING (as of 1st April 2020) Declarations: The trial design is in accordance with Declaration of Helsinky and the protocol, care report form and informed consent formularies were reviewed and approved by FNKV University Hospital Research Ethics Board (""Ethical Committee"") on 1st April 2020 (decision number KH 14-00-2020).",Phase 3

The laboratory plans to perform immunophenotyping of peripheral T-cells in patients with COVID-19 and complications (ARDS, ITU admission, myocardial injury) and map this against clinical patient outcomes. The aim is to determine if there is a specific T-cell immunophenotype associated with COVID-19 and/or complications, which can be used to inform prognosis and potential therapies. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Infection with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is designated a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).COVID-19 infection can result in severe lung inflammation which, when present, dominates the clinical course for most patients. However, other organs may also be involved and the cardiovascular (CV) system appears to have complex interactions with COVID-19. Published reports suggest evidence of heart muscle damage in 20-40% of hospitalised cases presenting as cardiac chest pain, heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac death. Many affected were previously well, but approximately half of those admitted to hospital COVID-19 have other medical problems, increasing in those requiring ITU admission or those that died. Patients with pre-existing CV conditions have some of the worst outcomes. Although pre-existing disorders reduce an individual's capacity to withstand severe illness, it is also likely that CV diseases may increase the risk of developing complicated COVID-19 disease. Our hypothesis is that immunological abnormalities acquired as a consequence of pre-existing disorders is responsible for this. A question central to potential therapeutic options is the extent to which COVID-19 related myocardial injury results from viral replication (cytopathic), is immune mediated or is due to other mechanisms. Given that rapid onset cardiac injury can occur at 7-14 days after onset of COVID symptoms we propose to evaluate the contribution of adaptive T-cell mediated immunity in patients with and without myocardial injury. If successful, we may be able to identify treatments that suppress discrete components of the immune system to prevent myocardial damage without depressing protective immune function.",N/A

This investigator-led, non-commercial, non-interventional does not collect any patient identifiable information. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Performing cardiac surgery in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection is potentially at risk of marked post-operative hemodynamic failure (shock) due to the inflammatory reaction generated by the surgery and the extracorporeal circulation associated with the viral infection. In addition, in the absence of infection, 30-50% of patients will experience acute post-operative respiratory failure due to the combined effects of extracorporeal circulation and general anesthesia. The pulmonary tropism of the virus therefore is susceptible to increase in post-operative respiratory impairment. Thus, the infection is likely to favor the occurrence of post-operative shock but also to aggravate respiratory failure and other post-operative organ failures. Therefore, the investigators designed an observational study that aims at comparing two groups of patients: - Cardiac or thoracic surgery patients with a negative Covid-19 PCR pre-operatively and in the 5 following days - Cardiac or thoracic surgery patients with a positive Covid-19 PCR in the 5 days before or after surgery",N/A

Our hypothesis is that in patients with chronic diseases, confinement leads to changes in health behaviours, adherence to pharmacological treatment, lifestyle rules and increased psychosocial stress with an increased risk of deterioration in their health status in the short, medium and long term. Some messages about the additional risk/danger associated with taking certain drugs in the event of COVID disease have been widely disseminated in the media since March 17, 2020, the date on which containment began in France. This is the case, for example, for corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but also for converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs2). These four major classes of drugs are widely prescribed in patients with chronic diseases, diseases specifically selected in our study (corticosteroids: haematological malignancies, multiple sclerosis, Horton's disease; ACE inhibitors/ARAs2: heart failure, chronic coronary artery disease). Aspirin used at low doses as an anti-platelet agent in coronary patients as a secondary prophylaxis after a myocardial infarction can be stopped by some patients who consider aspirin to be a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Discontinuation of this antiplatelet agent, which must be taken for life after an infarction, exposes the patient to a major risk of a new cardiovascular event. The current difficulty of access to care due to travel restrictions (a theoretical limit in the context of French confinement but a priori very real), the impossibility of consulting overloaded doctors, or the cancellation of medical appointments, medical and surgical procedures due to the reorganization of our hospital and private health system to better manage COVID-19 patients also increases the risk of worsening the health status of chronic patients who by definition require regular medical monitoring. Eight Burgundian cohorts of patients with chronic diseases (chronic coronary artery disease, heart failure, multiple sclerosis, Horton's disease, AMD, haemopathic malignancy, chronic respiratory failure (idiopathic fibrosis, PAH) haemophilia cohort) will study the health impact of the containment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A

This study consists of two phases: the first phase is a cross-sectional study and the second phase is a case-control study. The cross-sectional study is described here (the case-control study is described in a separate ClinicalTrials.gov record). ***  *** Detailed Description *** The world is currently in the midst of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that is caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to published cohort studies on COVID-19 infected patients, the most prevalent symptoms consist of fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, sputum production, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhoea, and sore throat. Recently, there have been concerns of significant viral transmission through asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or even mildly symptomatic patients. There is increasing anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare professionals highlighting isolated loss of sense of smell (anosmia) and taste disturbances (dysgeusia) as atypical symptoms of COVID-19 infection in otherwise asymptomatic patients. In parallel, expert statements from the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (ENT UK), British Rhinological Society, and the American Association of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) have suggested that olfactory and taste disturbances could be a clinical feature of COVID-19 infection. Rapidly emerging evidence from Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States have found olfactory and taste disturbances to be highly prevalent in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In contrast, there is currently limited evidence from Asia on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 infection. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to study the prevalence and characteristics of olfactory and taste disturbance in patients with COVID-19 infection in Malaysia. COVID-19 positive patients will be recruited from participating Malaysian Ministry of Health-designated COVID-19 treating hospitals across the country. Participants will answer an online questionnaire to evaluate and characterise these symptoms.",N/A

No definite treatment is recommended for COVID19 caused by the novel SARS Cov-2. The current standard of care is only supportive. In vitro studies and small clinical studies in China have demonstrated clinical efficacy of Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Antiviral properties of Azithromycin have also been demonstrated. However, the exact dosage of the medication and duration of treatment are not well established. This study wants to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in standard dose and high dose separately and standard dose in combination with azithromycin in treatment of COVID-19. If efficacy is proven, then early treatment will decrease infectivity of cases and also lead to quicker recovery which will decrease burden on healthcare facilities. Background SARS CoV-2 is a novel corona virus that has led to a pandemic of respiratory illness with high mortality. It is predominantly spread by respiratory droplets and also by fomites [1]. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can transmit the virus [2, 3, 4]. Average period of transmission is estimated to be 5 - 14 d but transmission upto 28 d is known. The disease was initially discovered when a series of unusual pneumonia cases were detected in Wuhan, China [5]. The commonest presentation is an influenza-like illness. Fever, dry cough and breathlessness are the commonest symptoms reported [6, 7]. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) at present is estimated to be between 0.25 - 3 [8] Elderly, those with heart disease, respiratory disease or diabetes and a combination of these are found to be at highest risk [9, 10]. No definite treatment is known and at present guidelines only recommend supportive care. A rapid cure can result in decreased period of infectivity and also decrease respiratory morbidity and mortality. Various trial drugs are being tested. Lopinavir-ritonavir combination has not been found to be effective in one study [11]. Hydroxychloroquine has been found to have both in vitro and in vivo antiviral properties. It also decreases progression to ARDS in patients with severe pneumonia by its immunomodulatory effects [12, 13, 14]. Various dosage regimes have been suggested based on modelling studies and small clinical observational studies. Yao and colleagues recommend a dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BD on D1 and 400mg daily on D2 - 5 based on their modelling study [13]. Cumulative toxicity of chloroquine occurs beyond 5g and the drug has a large volume of distribution with an elimination half-life of 20 - 60d and with a tendency to accumulate in higher concentrations in metabolically active tissue than in the serum [15, 16]. Azithromycin has also been shown to have antiviral activity especially against Ebola and Zika viruses. AZT induces antiviral responses in bronchial epithelial cells. AZT decreases viral replication of rhinovirus. Their combination is hypothesised to have synergistic effect but this has not been proven yet. The combination of HCQ +AZT has proven to be effective in Ebola. SARS Cov-2 clearance has been demonstrated in patients administered a combination of HCQ +AZT [17]. Other drugs like Remedesivir, favipravir and Chinese herbal medicines are all being studied in various trials [18, 19]. Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are cheap, widely available and with a good safety profile. Hence, the imperative to prove their efficacy to treat COVID-19. This study will compare three treatment regimens one with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in standard dose (HCQs) alone, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (AZT) and third with hydroxychloroquine in high dose (HCQh) and determine which regime is the best to treat hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 in armed forces hospitals. Objectives: 1. To compare efficacy of HCQs versus HCQ + AZT versus HCQh in treatment of COVID-19 among patients admitted to Indian Armed Forces Hospitals. 2. To compare safety of HCQ versus HCQ +AZT versus HCQh alone in treatment of COVID-19 among patients admitted to Indian Armed Forces Hospitals.

The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-573. TAK-573 is being tested to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The study will enroll approximately 86 participants (approximately 30 participants in dose escalation phase and 7 participants per cohort with a total of 8 cohorts in dose expansion phase). The dose escalation phase will enroll participants with solid tumors. The dose escalation phase is to evaluate single agent recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) which could be either MTD or PAD. The dose expansion phase will be initiated once the MTD and /or PAD are determined for TAK-573. The dose expansion phase will enroll participants in 8 cohorts for participants with advanced or metastatic: NSCLC, CRPC, MSI-high solid tumors with acquired resistance to CPIs, melanoma with acquired resistance to CPIs, head-and-neck with acquired resistance to CPIs, TNBC, PDAC and MSS colon cancer. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants with demonstrated clinical benefit may continue treatment beyond 1 year if approved by the sponsor. The overall time to participate in this study is 43 months. All participants will make an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a safety follow up assessment.",Phase 1

In particular, hypertension was present in 30% of the cases, diabetes in 19%, coronary heart disease in 8% and chronic obstructive lung disease in 3% of the patients. Amazingly, in the two major studies published in the Lancet and in the New England Journal of Medicine, the weight of the subjects as well their body mass index (BMI) were omitted. However, obesity, alone or in association with diabetes, can be a major predisposition factor for Covid-19 infection. Obesity is associated with a systemic low-grade inflammation state with increase circulating levels on many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6 . Belonging to the innate immune system but sharing characteristics with the adaptive immunity, natural killer (NK) cells are activated in the white adipose tissue of subjects with obesity where they proliferate and trigger M1 macrophage accumulation. NK cells are the first line of defense against viral infections. They mediate cytolysis or apoptosis of virus-infected cells. Moreover, NK cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines with antiviral activity. Not only NK cells frequency is reduced in subjects with obesity but also their cytotoxic capabilities are reduced. A lower NK cell activity is also present in subjects with type 2 diabetes .Therefore, subjects with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes should have an enhanced susceptibility to viral infections. It has been shown that hypertension is associated with Covid19 infection in 24-30% of the cases while diabetes was present in 12% to 22% of the patients. It is now recognized that lipids perform numerous indispensable cellular functions and some of them are involved in the activation of the immune active cells. In addition, lipids are involved in multiple steps in the virus replication cycle, and a recent article showed how metabolic remodelling of host lipids is significantly associated with the propagation of the human-pathogenic coronavirus. Lipids show both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities and interact with the immune response through the activation of lipid-reactive T cells. Ceramides (Cer), phospholipid or sphingolipid, but also amino acids and free fatty acids (FFA), activate the pro-inflammatory pathways resulting in the activation of toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) that play a role in cell proliferation and activation of T-cells. The platelet-activating factor, (also known as PAF, PAF-acether or AGEPC, i.e. acetyl-glyceryl-ether-phosphorylcholine), can also be involved. PAF is a potent phospholipid activator and mediator of many leukocyte functions, platelet aggregation and degranulation, inflammation, and anaphylaxis. Moreover, it is an important mediator of bronchoconstriction. We hypothesize that several lipids may serve as biomarkers of patients who will develop a more severe reaction to the virus. Measurement of plasma lipidomic profile will help in finding subjects more at risk to severe pulmonary disease and in helping to target treatment strategy. The primary end-point of our prospective, observational study is to assess the recovery rate in patients with diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. Among the other secondary end-points, we intend to find the predictors of the time to clinical improvement or hospital discharge in patients affected by Covid-19 pneumonia. Clinical improvement is defined as the reduction in severity of Covid-19 pneumonia expressed as the transition from a higher severity to a less severity condition. The possible outcomes are 1. Death; 2. hospitalization, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and/or invasive mechanical ventilation; 3. hospitalization, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy and/or noninvasive mechanical ventilation; 4. hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5. hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints will include liver, kidney or multiorgan failure, cardiac failure, the efficacy of different pharmaceutical treatment against Covid-19 and the development of predictors and biomarkers of the severity of Covid-19 infection. Methods Before starting the study, the protocol will be submitted to and approved by the local Ethical Committees at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. Before enrollment each subject will sign the informed consent. Inclusion criteria: hospitalized subjects of both sexes aged 18 years or older with diagnosis of pneumonia, confirmed by chest imaging and oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≤ 94% in ambient air, Covid-19 test positive, given informed consent to data collection from the patient or from the patient's legal representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent. Exclusion criteria: age lower than 18 years, pregnancy or breast-feeding. Nasopharyngeal swab samples will be taken for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to make diagnosis of Covid19 (2 repeated tests). Data collected include time of symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, asthenia, arthralgia) age, sex, height, weight, education, alcohol and smoking habits, morbidities, plasma glucose, creatinine, transaminases, γ-GT, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, complete blood count, D-dimer, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinkinase (CK), ferritin, albumin, HbA1c, chest X rays, chest CT scan, therapy for pneumonia, other treatments including anti-hypertensive and anti-hyperglycemic agents, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen flow rate or other types of oxygen treatment. Five ml of plasma divided in aliquots of 1 ml each will be also obtained and stored at −80°C in anonymized way for future analysis, including third parties. Primary end-point The primary end-point of the study is to compare the mean recovery rate in patients with diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia, who present with complications at the time of hospital admission (such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension or respiratory failure), with the mean recovery rate in patients without any of the above-mentioned complications. Secondary end-points A secondary end-point of the study is the comparison of the survival curves (times to improvement) in the two groups (patients with and without complications) and among patients presenting with different types of complications: 1. Hypertension 2. Obesity and/or type 2 diabetes 3. Cardiovascular disease 4. Chronic obstructive lung disease 5. None of the above diseases Other endpoints are liver, kidney or multiorgan failure, cardiac failure, the efficacy of different pharmaceutical treatment against Covid-19 and the development of predictors and biomarkers of the severity of Covid-19 infection. Sample size The sample size computation (20) is performed under the following hypotheses: the rate of recovery for patients without complications is supposed to be 98%; the average rate of recovery for patients with one of the following complications: diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension or chronic respiratory failure, is supposed to be 88%. Moreover, it is supposed that the ratio between the sizes of the two groups is k=Nc/Nwc = 1, under the assumption that 50% of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia have one of the above-mentioned complications. We are, in fact, including overweight and obesity. To reach a power of 0.80, with a ratio k of 1, the probabilities of improvement equal to pc = 0.88 and pwc =0.98 and with an expected difference rates of 0.10, the sample size required is 198 patients if α is equal to 0.05. Statistics The association between recovery and patient groups will be tested by means of a Fisher exact test. A Cox Proportional-Hazard regression will be used to compare survival curves (times to improvement) among the studied groups by correcting for the administered therapy and for all the quantitative collected variables. Quantitative variables, measured at hospital admission, will be compared among groups using ANOVA. In univariable analyses, categorical variables, as gender, education, alcohol consumption and smoke habits will be analysed by means of a Chi-Squared test to study their association with the recovery, while a logistic regression model will be used to test possible quantitative predictors of recovery. A multivariable logistic model, with a stepwise selection procedure, will be then used to test all the variables that are significant in a univariable analysis.",N/A

France, which has more than 17,000 deaths from the virus, is one of the main outbreaks. As of 16 April 2020, more than 76,000 individuals in France have been hospitalized, corresponding to 69% of confirmed cases (https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr). Most affected patients have more or less marked clinical signs associating fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, digestive disorders. In some cases, the progression is worse with lung disease of varying severity. Indications for hospitalization are essentially the severe forms of Covid-19 disease, characterized by hypoxemic lung disease. Risk factors for developing severe Covid-19 disease have been identified already: age, co-morbidity such as diabetes, obesity-overweight or cardiovascular diseases. It is assumed that other host-related factors, including genetics, may contribute to the existence of this phenotypic heterogeneity. At present, these factors are not known. The objective of this research is to constitute a DNA collection from patients with Covid-19, in order to be able to search for genetic factors modulating the clinical phenotype.",N/A

Infection with this virus of the coronavirus family is causing a broad clinical spectrum, the main manifestation of which is an influenza-like condition associated with a pattern of severe hypoxemia pneumonia, and in some cases fatal. Little is known about this pathology, so we propose to carry out an observational cohort of patients treated in our hospital for an SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort should make it possible to clinically, biologically and radiologically characterize the SARS-CoV-2 infections. We will also collect the therapeutic strategies implemented, their possible toxicity and the evolution of the patients. ***  *** Detailed Description *** COVID-19 is a virus belonging to the coronavirus family, which includes a large number of viruses that can cause a wide variety of diseases in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the current COVID-19 pandemic, although widely described in the literature, still has many grey areas. The main clinical manifestation is an influenza-like illness associated with respiratory tract infection that can lead to severe hypoxemic pneumonia with fatal outcomes in 2.3% of cases. The clinical spectrum is not yet very well known, as evidenced by the evidence of anosmia, agueusia, or recent skin manifestations, but also strong suspicion of possible neurological damage. Similarly, it is not yet very well established, apart from certain co-morbidities, which patients are likely to develop serious forms requiring admission to intensive care, as shown by the proportion of patients < 60 years of age admitted to intensive care for ARDS. Moreover, the question of how to manage these patients still raises many questions, particularly about the type of molecules to be introduced and at what point in the history of the disease. Some of these molecules, such as the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combinations and the Hydroxychloroquine/ Azithromycin combination, are not free of complications, particularly cardiac complications requiring close monitoring by ECGs and repeated dosing, the effectiveness of which has not yet been clearly demonstrated. In order to better understand this infection, we propose to set up a cohort of patients treated for CoV-2 SARS infection on our site.

To date, treatments are currently being evaluated and none of them have shown to be effective in the care of these patients. The use of convalescent plasma is a passive immunotherapy. It has often been used in respiratory virus epidemic situations (during the 1918 or 2009 influenza pandemic, or during SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV pandemic). Effects reported in literature are in favour of a beneficial impact of transfusion of these plasma without serious adverse effects reported. PlasCoSSA is a randomized, controlled, triple-blinded, parallel clinical trial. This study tests the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion therapy in the early care of COVID-19 hospitalized patients outside intensive care units. ***  *** Detailed Description *** During SARS-CoV-2 infection, two clinical-biological phases can be observed: an initial viral phase followed by an immunological phase whose onset has been associated with more severe prognosis. Hospitalized patients with comorbidities or clinical risk factors have a higher risk of respiratory functions deterioration and significant risk to need intensive care. Early transfusion of convalescent plasma (2 units of 200-230 mL of apheresis plasma inactivated by amotosalen) would prevent this secondary worsening and reduce the risk to be transferred to intensive care, length of stay and mortality. Considering clinical and biological manifestations of the disease, including coagulation disorders, endothelial alterations, immunological disorders, it seems interesting to compare this convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2 lacking antibodies plasma.",Phase 3

As a consequence, all routine surgery, out-patient activity and day cases have been postponed or cancelled altogether. It is therefore critical for us to understand whether or not this disease will continue to threaten staff health or whether natural infection will give rise to long lasting immunity. This is a 2-arm prospective cohort study recruiting at least 1000 healthcare workers at GOSH over 6 years.Staff will be recruited and coordinated from each department to be representative of the full diversity of healthcare workers at the Trust. The age distribution of the participants will be monitored on a weekly, basis against the known age distribution of the hospital to ensure that the sample is representative. Trust communications team will send an all staff email to inform them about this research project asking them to get in touch with the study team if they wish to participate and they meet the basic eligibility criteria. Potential participants will be asked voluntarily to attend a face to face appointment in person (or if preferred by telephone or 1:1 video teleconference meeting) to enable trained study staff to seek informed consent before they enter the study. Informed consent will be undertaken by study staff who are Good Clinical Practice trained, Human Tissue Act trained, study trained, GOSH consent trained and registered in the study log. The consent process will specifically cover the reason for the study, the storage of samples and agreement for future samples to be tested once improved testing is made available. Once the member of staff has provided informed consent, they will be asked to undertake an online questionnaire in which they will record demographic details including age, sex, email address and telephone contact for results and coordinating follow up. The questionnaire will also record details of SARS-CoV-2 like symptoms, contact with SARS-CoV-2, pre-existing co-morbidities and medication or treatments that may interfere with serological testing. After providing informed consent, the staff members then be asked attend the study phlebotomy testing clinic. Appointments will be 20 minutes in length but actual blood sampling for serological testing will be 5-10 minutes to allow plenty of time and space for staff members to be tested to maintain social distancing. A total of 8ml of blood will be stored for testing. Follow up sampling and questionnaires of approximately 200 staff members with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected staff will take place monthly. While follow up of all ~800 asymptomatic staff members will take place 6 monthly. All staff will continue to have access to the GOSH PCR COVID19 testing program (as they do at present). This will enable us to confirm with PCR testing any new (or reinfected) positive staff member with COVID-19 over the duration of the study. When initially asymptomatic seronegative staff become serologically positive during the course of the study, they will remain under active surveillance but they will switch arms of the study and they will contribute to the active follow up of serologically positive patients. If staff leave the GOSH NHS trust during the study they will still be eligible to remain in the study and be followed up and we will update their contact details on the follow-up questionnaire.

This study consists of two phases: the first phase is a cross-sectional study and the second phase is a case-control study. The case-control study is described here (the cross-sectional study is described in a separate ClinicalTrials.gov record). ***  *** Detailed Description *** The world is currently in the midst of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that is caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to published cohort studies on COVID-29 infected patients, the most prevalent symptoms consist of fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, sputum production, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhoea, and sore throat. Recently, there have been concerns of significant viral transmission through asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or even mildly symptomatic patients. There is increasing anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare professionals highlighting isolated loss of sense of smell (anosmia) and taste disturbances (dysgeusia) as atypical symptoms of COVID-19 infection in otherwise asymptomatic patients. In parallel, expert statements from the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (ENT UK), British Rhinological Society, and the American Association of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) have suggested that olfactory and taste disturbances could be a clinical feature of COVID-19 infection. Rapidly emerging evidence from Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States have found olfactory and taste disturbances to be highly prevalent in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In contrast, there is currently limited evidence from Asia on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 infection. Additionally, there is also limited evidence on the predictive value of screening for olfactory and taste disturbance in COVID-19 patients with subclinical symptoms. The aim of this case-control study is to study the predictive value of screening for olfactory and taste disturbance in patients with COVID-19 infection in Malaysia. The cases will be selected from the cohort of COVID-19 positive patients recruited from participating Malaysian Ministry of Health-designated COVID-19 treating hospitals across the country (from Phase 1 of the Malaysian COVID-19 Anosmia Study). Controls will be recruited from healthy volunteers who will will answer the an online questionnaire to evaluate and characterise their olfactory and taste symptoms.

Prevention and/or treatment with a widely-available and already-licensed product such as vitamin D (cholecalciferol) could have a large impact on healthcare worldwide. Given ethnic variation in vitamin D production, this could help to address the discrepancies in how people of different ethnicities are affected by COVID-19. There are currently no published studies analysing either individual-level evidence on the effect of vitamin D status on COVID-19 outcomes, or any prospective studies planning on following-up patients with reference to vitamin D and COVID-19 infection. The study will have 2 arms. Arm 1 will recruit patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Vitamin D levels will be measured in these patients and compared with outcome measures of COVID-19 severity. In Arm 2, patients will be recruited prospectively from local general practices (GPs) with measurement of vitamin D levels at enrolment. They will be followed up after 6 months to determine whether baseline vitamin D levels correspond with developing COVID-19. Data will be collected from a mixture of patient medical records, electronic patient records, laboratory data and from patients themselves. Data in Arm 1 will be analysed with a combination of linear and logistic regression, as appropriate, and with adjustment for covariates. Data in Arm 2 will be analysed as a case-control study, with adjustment for covariates. The primary objectives are to determine whether vitamin D levels affect outcomes in COVID-19 infection and whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk. ***  *** Detailed Description *** STUDY DESIGN Arm 1: Hospital in-patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 This will be an observational cohort study of patients hospitalised at Tameside General Hospital with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, as defined by the clinical coding department. Patient identifiers will be extracted by the coding department and held on a secure server at Tameside Hospital. Identifiers will be used to ensure serum samples already taken as part of routine clinical management of these patients can be processed for a vitamin D level. No additional blood samples will need to be taken. Patient demographic details will be extracted from their clinical notes and electronic patient records, then placed on an anonymised database for analysis. Data will be analysed to determine the following: 1. Are vitamin D levels associated with outcomes/prognosis in patients hospitalised with COVID-19? 2. Are vitamin D levels associated with ethnicity in patients hospitalised with COVID-19? 3. Are vitamin D levels associated with comorbidity in patients hospitalised with COVID-19? Projected recruitment is 200 patients to be opportunistically recruited who are undergoing usual clinical care for COVID-19. Arm 2: Primary care patients prospectively studied with reference to baseline vitamin D and risk of COVID-19 Patients will be prospectively recruited from local GP surgeries within the Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group. Patients will be consented by Good Clinical Practice (GCP)-certified practitioners. A serum sample will be collected on recruitment for a baseline vitamin D level to be obtained. Patient contact details will be collected, as well as baseline health status and comorbidities, then stored on an encrypted database on a secure server at Tameside Hospital. Vitamin D levels will be communicated to GP surgeries and GPs can decide whether to treat patients according to local treatment guidelines for suboptimal vitamin D. After 6 months, patients will be followed-up via telephone interview, in order to ascertain whether they have developed COVID-19, any treatment outcomes for this, and whether they have been treated with vitamin D in the interim in primary/secondary/tertiary care. Data will be analysed once all recruited patients have been followed-up after 6 months. At follow-up, patients who have developed COVID-19 will be deemed to be cases, and those who have not will be deemed to be controls, for a case-control analysis using vitamin D levels as an exploratory covariate. It is anticipated that there will be some patient drop-out, but compliance with follow-up is likely to be high, due to the use of a telephone interview. Analysis will aim to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the risk of developing COVID-19, with reference to additional covariates, such as ethnicity and comorbidity. Projected recruitment is 800 patients to be opportunistically recruited who are attending their GP surgery for routine care, not necessarily related to COVID-19. INCLUSION CRITERIA Arm 1 Inclusion criteria: - Aged >=18 years. - Inpatient admitted to Tameside General Hospital. - Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 - not necessary for SARS-CoV-2 swab to be positive. - Patients on vitamin D treatment to be included, but this will be adjusted for in analysis. Exclusion criteria: - Aged <18 years. - Final clinical diagnosis NOT COVID-19. Arm 2 Inclusion criteria: - Aged >=18 years. - Patients on vitamin D treatment to be included, but this will be adjusted for in analysis. Exclusion criteria: - Aged <18 years. - On active treatment for malignancy/diagnosis of cancer within 6 months prior to enrolment. - Patients on immunosuppression. ANALYSIS Arm 1 Mean values of age and gender, as well as proportions of different ethnic groups, will be used to assess group comparability. Primary analysis will involve linear regression of vitamin D levels (as a continuous variable, with adjustment for age and gender) against variables representing COVID-19 treatment outcomes: - Mode of oxygen therapy (low-flow <10L/min, high-flow>=10L/min, nasal high-flow, CPAP, endotracheal intubation). - Treatment history (excluding oxygen therapy). - Discharge. - Death. Primary analysis will also include logistic regression of ethnic groups against the above treatment outcome variables, with adjustment for age, gender and vitamin D status. The following variables will be included as additional predictors of severity: - Admission SpO2. - Chest x-ray findings on admission. - CRP on admission. - D-dimer on admission. - Creatinine on admission. - Adjusted calcium on admission. - Treatment with vitamin D. - Ethnicity. The following variables will be included as covariates: - Age. - Gender. - Comorbidities. - BMI. - Presence of diabetes. - SARS-CoV-2 swab result. Linear regression will be reported as a coefficient with a 95% confidence interval. Logistic regression will be reported as an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Missing data will be imputed. Analysis will be carried out once all data has been collected for n=200 patients and serum vitamin D levels are available.

Dental surgeries reopened on May 11th, with a limited focus on urgent care, by applying new occupational hygiene standards to limit the circulation of SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus. Hypothesis. From May 11th, chronic patients and elderly patients who come to the hospital for dental consultations will have two risks of malnutrition: 1) because of confinement (loneliness, anorexia, difficulty shopping) and 2) because of the untreated dental problem (oral pain or untreated edentulism). Main objective. To investigate whether dentists' recommendation to consult a physician is efficient to prevent or to treat malnutrition. Secondary objective. Conduct a medico-economic study to assess the health savings generated by the prevention of malnutrition by dentists. Type of study and population studied. Prospective cohort study including 100 adults received in hospital dental consultation, malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. Inclusion criteria. All subjects answering ""yes"" to one of these two questions: 1) ""Do you eat less?"" and/or 2) ""Have you lost weight?"" Exclusion criteria. None. Study design and evaluation criteria. At baseline, for all subjects included, the dentist will check the weight (kg, weighed), the usual weight (kg, question), height (m, question or from ID card), masticatory ability (score 0%-100%) and oral pain (score 0-10). Then the dentist will give the patient a note advising him to consult his doctor for assessment and management of malnutrition. The dentist will call the patient 1 month (M1) and 3 months (M3) after baseline, to ask him for his weight (kg), if he consulted his doctor (yes/no) and received nutritional supplements (if yes, what prescription).

In addition to nosocomial transmission, the health care workers (HCWs), defined as persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, are also exposed to community transmission. Whether HCWs acquire infection at work or in the community is important to adapt protection measures. A few studies investigated COVID-19 infection among medical and nursing personnel. However, none have analyzed all categories of hospital staff. As of April 9, 2020, a total of 9,282 US HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 had been reported to CDC (US), however description of occupational activities was not available. Therefore, limited information is available about COVID-19 infection among HCWs. Thus, the objectives of the sdudy are to estimate the incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in five university hospitals (including geriatric hospitals) of the great Paris area and to estimate both nosocomial and community risk factors. Method: A prospective and retrospective cohort study that includes all hospital staff (including medical and nursing personnel, health care managers, laboratory, radiology, reception staffs, stretcher-bearers, etc.) working in different departments of five university hospitals (acute medical centers and geriatric hospitals) in the great Paris area (9 000 HCWs). Incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will be estimated with its 95%CI. Individual and contextual risk factors will be analyzed using multilevel multivariate logistic regression modelling to account for clustering and confounding. Conclusion This study should make it possible to better characterize SARS-Cov-2 contamination of HCWs and to estimate the share of nosocomial transmission. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Details for ""Study design"" section Time perspective : Retrospective and prospective cohort study.

Moreover, viral load will be measured by RT-PCR in the subgroup positive to IgG antibodies. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The Coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China, for the first time in late 2019 is a new viral strain that has never previously been identified in humans. It has been called SARS-CoV-2 and the respiratory disease that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals has represented and continues to represent a significant criticality both for the risk of spreading the disease and for the organizational aspects that follow. Currently the gold standard for the non-invasive diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of the viral genome by RT-PCR. However, despite the high specificity, this technique has a low sensitivity and can produce false negative samples. Furthermore, detection of the viral genome is indicative of active infection and fails to identify subjects previously exposed to the virus who have passed the infection asymptomatically. Serological tests can detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood or serum samples and, depending on the type of antibody detected, identify the subjects in the active phase of the infection and after the resolution of the infection, the whose diagnosis was not made by performing a swab. We will evaluate the actual spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the hospital personnel of Humanitas through the monitoring of the levels of IgG antibodies. Moreover, viral load will be measured by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs in the subgroup positive to IgG antibodies. Secondary endpoints are: visualize the trend of the antibody value at 3, 6 and 12 months; correlation between the antibody titer in test positive subjects and the viral load of the nasopharyngeal swab; identification of predictive variables of susceptibility to viral SARS-CoV2 infection.",N/A

Described at the end of 2019 in China, the pandemic sees the number of patients increasing worldwide, Europe being still in the ascending phase of the epidemic and the American continent at the very beginning of it. Haemostasis abnormalities have been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis in these patients with this pneumonia. In a Chinese series of 183 patients, the hemostasis balance including thrombin time, fibrinogenemia, fibrin degradation products and antithrombin III were within normal limits. Only the D-Dimer assay was positive in the whole cohort with an average rate of 0.66 µg / mL (normal <50 µg / mL). These hemostasis parameters were abnormal mainly in patients who died during their management; the levels of D-dimers and fibrin degradation products were significantly higher while the antithrombin III was reduced. The findings on the particular elevation of D-dimers in deceased patients as well as the significant increase in thrombin time were also reported in another series. Higher numbers of pulmonary embolisms have been reported in patients with severe form of SARS-COV2 (data in press). This research is based on the hypothesis that the existence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) could make it possible to screen patients at risk of pulmonary embolism and to set up a curative anticoagulation. This is all the more important since the occurrence of a pulmonary embolism can clearly worsen the right ventricular failure possibly observed during mechanical ventilation in these patients. Cohort study, non-interventional, multicentric, prospective, non-comparative, longitudinal. The main objective of the research is to describe the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in patients hospitalized in intensive care for acute respiratory failure linked to documented SARS-COV2 pneumonia, within 24 hours of their admission. The secondary objectives of the research are: - Identify the factors associated with the existence of deep vein thrombosis - Describe the relationship between the inflammatory status of patients on admission and the existence of DVT during follow-up. - Describe the relationship between the results of the hemostasis assessment and the existence of deep vein thrombosis during follow-up. - Describe the relationship between a right ventricular failure or dysfunction during follow-up and the existence of DVT. - Describe the relationship between mortality and the existence of DVT, within 28 days of the patient's admission to intensive care or intensive care.

Patients with certain risk factors seem to die by an overwhelming reaction of the immune system to the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) and resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Several pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19, include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer, and low platelets. There is increasing data that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that TCZ can reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS. The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with TCZ reduces the severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background and Rationale The Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan/China, is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on an individual basis, and, on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy to its limits. The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease, COVID-19, has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 3.7%, which is more than 10-fold higher than the mortality of influenza. An infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause an excessive host immune response, leading to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer and low platelets. There is increasing evidence, that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in a pragmatic manner, already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS (and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), with a good safety profile also in the elderly). Collectively, the data strongly suggest that neutralization of the inflammatory pathway induced by IL-6 may reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS.",Phase 2

This should not overlook the fact that some treatments, surgeries and examinations of non-Covid-19 patients must imperatively be maintained according to the assessment of their risk-benefit balance. In context, it appears that this is not always the case. In addition to the necessary social containment measures, there are general limitations on patient access to the operating theater, neglecting the individual interest of naive non-Covid-19 patients. Certain studies which report a higher and earlier risk of death of undetected and ultimately operated Covid-19 patients has reinforced, as a precaution, the massive deprogramming of naive patients and the restrictive access of surgical care for all. We believe that this could lead to a risk of delayed treatments and renunciation of care for naive patients who should not be considered at risk a priori in the event of surgery. The individual clinical and local health context should be first considered for appropriate surgical decision-making. As such, the French Department of Health and Human Services (DGS) has given general guidelines regarding the maintenance of follow-up and care for non-Covid-19 patients in this context of containment and major mobilization of health care professionals to care for people with COVID. Surgeries which could not be postponed because of the patient's status or if their postponement exposed to a significant risk of loss of chance, if needed in the light of the recommendations issued by learned societies, were concerned. In this sense, the investigator have selected the naive Covid-19 patients from Nice Hospital who should benefit from elective or urgent urological surgeries, taking into account their individual risk and the territorial epidemic rate. Their rate of ICU stays following their surgery has been analysed and their surgical follow-up outcomes during the epidemic period evaluated, according to the anti-Covid-19 measures established in Nice Hospital by comparing them to an earlier period without Covid-19.",N/A

Once the dose will be determined by each type of patient group (severely ill vs. very severely ill) has been determined, phase 2 of the study will begin, where the safety and efficacy of the use of plasma will be evaluated based on clinical, imaging and laboratory criteria. So, our hypotheses are: 1. Is there a minimum effective dose to treat seriously ill patients with convalescent plasma with COVID-19? 2. the plasma dose with the minimum effective effect will improve the clinical, laboratory and clearance conditions of the presence of the virus in the severely ill patient? ***  *** Detailed Description *** Specific objectives 1. Show the efficacy and safety of fresh plasma in different doses in severe cases and in very severe cases. 2. Assess whether fresh plasma can overcome negative prognostic factors in very severe ill patients with COVID-19 infection. These factors are age, high SOFA score, and high D-dimer. 3. To evaluate the titration of antiCOVID-19 antibodies and if its quantification is related to the therapeutic response. The responses to drug treatments that exist in our country such as hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin, lopinavir / ritonavir and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) are very heterogeneous, with high cost and diverse and serious adverse events in some cases. Absent randomized-controlled studies and case series or small cohort studies have not been shown to be more effective than supportive treatments in these patients. One more factor is that intubated patients cannot swallow and these medications are for oral posology; the only way to administer is through a nasogastric tube, so we cannot assure that its absorption is as expected and that the blood levels do not reach therapeutic levels. Therefore, we propose a treatment that in the first instance is in our hands, which has already proven to be effective in infection with highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola virus, Lassar fever and other coronavirus infections (SARS1 in 2003, MERS 2012). With regard to convalescent plasma, two studies have recently been published, a series of 5 and another of 10 cases, seriously ill and with no response to the mentioned therapies (hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin and lopinavir / ritonavir, among others). The outcomes in this series of cases have been reported satisfactory in most with few minimal adverse events (rash). Since the convalescent plasma dose is very ambiguous in the case-series reported, we will try to find this dose. Therefore, in this initial phase, we divided it into two severity groups: 1. . Severe ill group, convalescent plasma dose on day 0, evaluation on day +3 and if you continue with the clinic and laboratories, a second dose of plasma may be administered. Always watching the safety always (early and late transfusion reactions). Clinical evaluation (including oxygenation) as well as laboratory (days +6, +9, +12, +15, +18, +21 to find the necessary dose for response. The patients will be evaluated and if they meet the response points, the minimum effective plasma dose will be recommended for phase 2. 2. . Very severe ill group, convalescent plasma dose day 0, with evaluation on day +3, will add another dose of plasma if there is no improvement clinic or laboratory, reevaluate day +6 and if required, apply another dose of plasma if there will be not clinical or laboratory improvement. Always watching security. It is reassessed clinically (including respiratory parameters) on days +9, +12, +15, +18 and +21, to find the minimal dose necessary. This sequential treatment will help reduce the risk of water overload and also assess the presence of transfusion lung injury syndrome or TRALI. A second phase, the dose and safety of treatment will be evaluated. In the second phase , both early and late or B will be evaluated as follows: to. Sever ill cases: plasma will be applied according to the dose you will find in phase 1b. Security and response will be evaluated in this phase. b. Very sever ill cases: Plasma will be applied according to the dose you will find in phase 1b and the safety and response phase will be evaluated. It will also be open (the study will not be blinded), it will not be randomized, and it will be controlled only by the severity of the patient and their characteristics of the disease (severe vs. very severe), as well as being controlled by the amount of infusion of plasma (minimum effective dose).

This is a single-center, retrospective/ prospective registry enrolling all COVID-19 positive patients at Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection at Mount Sinai Hospital will be included. ***  *** Detailed Description *** STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective of the study is to estimate the frequency of cardiac arrhythmias and characterize the mode of death in patients with the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19). INTRODUCTION, RATIONALE The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has quickly become a pandemic, significantly impacting the health and economy of the United States and the rest of the world. There are over 500,000 cases and 24,000 deaths related to COVID-19 worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate ranging from 1-8%. The United States has been impacted by this pandemic significantly with over 80,000 cases and thousands of deaths reported; these numbers will continue to worsen. Patients infected with COVID-19 can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from an asymptomatic state to mild upper respiratory symptoms (with low-grade fever) to severe disease with hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) type lung injury. In the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure, ground glass opacification on chest imaging is found more than 50% of the time. COVID-19 has the potential to cause myocardial injury with at least 17% found to have an elevated troponin and 23% noted to have heart failure in a study of 191 inpatients from Wuhan, China. The prevalence of heart failure was significantly higher among non-survivors compared with survivors (52% vs. 12%). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of 341 patients, standardized mean difference of cardiac troponin I levels were significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19 related illness compared to those with non-severe disease (25.6, 95% CI 6.8-44.5). Furthermore, cases of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock have also been reported, with associated atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In a recent report from Wuhan, China, 16.7% of hospitalized and 44.4% of ICU patients with COVID-19 had cardiac arrhythmias. Given the potential sampling bias in sicker, hospitalized patients with hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown. Furthermore, as it is currently unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. Several medications eg: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab etc. are currently being investigated. Hydroxychloroquine is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and can cause drug-induced LQT. As such, these drugs are used concomitantly with other antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, Tikosyn, sotalol etc. which can be associated with QT prolongation requiring close EKG and cardiac monitoring. Improved characterization of arrhythmia burden and mechanism of death is critical, primarily in guiding the need for developing treatment strategies, additional arrhythmia monitoring and need to consider advanced prevention strategies including the role of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).",N/A

Ruxolitinib (INCB018424 phosphate, INC424, ruxolitinib phosphate) is a well established, potent and selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2, with modest to marked selectivity against tyrosine kinase (TYK)2 and JAK3, respectively. Ruxolitinib interferes with the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. Ruxolitinib (JAKAVI®) is currently approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF) and for the treatment of adult patients with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea (HU). In the US, ruxolitinib has been approved in the treatment of steroid refractory graft versus host disease post allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Because many patients with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 have features consistent with the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and increased activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, it is postulated that ruxolitinib might have a useful role in treating these patients.",Phase 2

This study will be performed as a pragmatic clinical trial. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Disease Progression and Timing of Intervention The intervention described herein focuses on adjustment of patient positioning aimed at improving gas exchange and lung function in patients harboring COVID-19. This intervention will target the inpatient setting generally. Scientific/Clinical Rationale for Approach Since emergence of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) now designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one in six affected patients becomes seriously ill. The lung appears to be the most susceptible target organ, with a large swath of symptomatic patients struggling with mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia resulting in respiratory failure. This respiratory failure is often fatal, with one study showing 28% non-survivors having experienced respiratory failure. Moreover, 81-97% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation do not survive. Like its interaction with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for COVID-19. Viral adherence to host-cell membrane associated ACE2 facilitates the proximity required for viral ""spike"" mediated genetic material injection. In COVID-19, this spike is 10-20 times more likely to bind ACE2 than SARS. ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells, with 83% of those cells being alveolar epithelial type II. In addition, gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the ACE2-expressing alveolar epithelial type II have high levels of multiple viral process-related genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life cycle, viral assembly, and viral genome replication, suggesting that the ACE2-expressing alveolar epithelial type II cells facilitate coronaviral replication in the lung. Thus, these cells likely serve as a ready reservoir for viral invasion. Perhaps more importantly, alveolar type II cells function to generate and recycle surfactant essential to respiratory activity. Surfactant defends against alveolar collapse at low lung volume and protects the lung from injuries/infections caused by inhaled particles and micro-organisms. In COVID-19, if these vital cells are being destroyed, alveolar failure may ensue with severe lung impairment. Thus, interventions that are aimed at improving pressure normalization and alveolar protection may be beneficial in these patients. Prone positioning (PP) has long been used to combat hypoxemia in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Improvements in gas exchange result from improved alveolar ventilation and blood flow redistribution with enhanced perfusion following. PP reduces lung over inflation and bolsters alveolar recruitment. PP also promotes uniformity of vertical pleural pressure gradients resulting in more uniform alveolar size. Considering these physiologic factors together, we hypothesize PP serves to balance stress and strain within the lungs of non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 leading to improved outcomes compared to traditional supine positioning. Prior Research Supporting the Positioning Model: Multiple studies have been conducted that support the use of PP as a proactive treatment to combat hypoxemia in ARDS. Each year, approximately 170,000 people are diagnosed with ARDS, and those diagnosed face mortality rates between 25% and 40%. The use of PP stretches back to the 1970s, as providers began to search for ways to ameliorate ARDS symptomatology and reduce the then even higher levels of mortality associated with it. Following initial reports that PP significantly improved oxygenation in 70-80% of patients with ARDS, it was adopted as a standard treatment option. Initially, randomized clinical trials struggled to replicate these findings, citing multiple limitations to study enrollment and treatment standardization that made ascertaining conclusive results difficult. Only as RCT construction has been refined to accommodate for these limitations have the benefits of PP been more clearly demonstrated. These beneficial effects have been recently upheld by the landmark PROSEVA study, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, that randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Their results demonstrated a significant improvement in both 28- and 90-day mortality rates: ""the 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67)"". Per these positive findings, PP has been consistently shown to be an effective mechanism to increase oxygenation in patients with ARDS when implemented under the following conditions: early enlisting of treatment and its consistent maintenance for at least 16 hours per day, and with concurrent use of lung-protective therapies. Translating these findings towards treatment of COVID-19 positive patients seems promising given the similarity of manifested symptoms and complications.",N/A

It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation of high demand and potential staff shortage in ICU. Also, the investigators need to reduce unnecessary exposure of the providers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. METHODS Objective: To explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard Chest PhysioTherapy (CPT) in the care of COVID-19. Design: A Pilot Multicenter Prospective Crossover Randomized Study. Setting: Two ICUs in Canadian Academic Hospitals (CHU Sainte Justine and Montreal General Hospital) Patients: All the mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician, with COVID-19 infection during the study period. Procedure: The investigators will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 hours apart over 3 hours. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV), suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. The order of the procedures (i.e. NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated. Measurements and Analyses: The primary outcome measure is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO2/FIO2 (SF) ratio). For the cases with Invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation, the investigators will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, desaturations, or unexpected extubations. The investigators will collect the data before, 10 minutes after, and 30 minutes after the procedure. Sample Size: The investigators estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (Total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90, alfa of 0.05, with the non-inferiority design. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS This randomized pilot study will be considered a running phase if the investigators can/should undertake the RCT which should follow without significant modification of the methods. ***  *** Detailed Description *** 1. BACKGROUND During COVID-19 pandemic, although the proportion of severe or fatal cases may vary by location, 15-30% of hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit in Italy and China (1-4). Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported (2, 3, 5). The symptomatic infection can range from mild to critical; but, generally, the clinical course seems to have characteristics of slow progression from upper airway to the lower and the other systemic organs such as cardiac muscles. Radiographic findings include ground-glass opacities, crazy paving appearance, air space consolidation, broncho-vascular thickening in the lesion with a slow progression up until 10-14 days from the onset of disease (6-8). Staff Shortage & Protection Protecting the workforce is another critical challenge. Sick leaves or self-isolation has increased already. Caring for infected patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staffs because of high and prolonged exposure to critically ill patients who presumably have higher viral shedding. This should be particularly noted for physiotherapists to whom chest physiotherapy can be prescribed more often than usual in this situation of ICU demand. On the other hand, only a limited number of physiotherapists are available in most of ICUs. Airway obstruction due to the production of secretion particularly with respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill is a major problem in clinical management. CPT has been proposed to assist in the clearance of tracheobronchial secretions. Techniques such as the conventional CPT with chest percussion and vibration, chest shaking and directed coughing may help to mobilize secretions towards the trachea and trigger coughing that could help to remove the secretions. However, a recent systematic review reported that there is no sufficient evidence to provide CPT in routine practice with a significant heterogeneity of the procedure techniques used (9-13). Extra-thoracic non-invasive oscillating devices (NIOD) are designed to interrupt the expiratory airflow and can help to secretions clearance. NIOD requires less patient cooperation and could be used without interruptions such as due to coughing or suctioning of secretion. Frequencer® (Dymedso, Montreal Canada) is a NIOD that locally target the affected lung areas. The safety has been attested particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis. In addition, this NIOD can be easily administered by non-specialized personnel such as respiratory therapists or registered nurses (14, 15). This proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel (respiratory therapist, nurse, physicians) versus standard CPT performed by a physiotherapist. 2. OBJECTIVES & RESEARCH QUESTIONS Objectives This project has 3 specific objectives: 1. To study the feasibility and tolerance of NIOD in the mechanically ventilated patients 2. To study if NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard CPT done by the physiotherapist in the care of COVID-19. 3. To study the impact of NIOD and CPT on oxygenation. Research questions to be asked 1. Is the NIOD safe and well-tolerated to be applied to critically ill patients with COVID-19? 2. Is the NIOD not inferior to standard CPT performed by a physiotherapist with respect to the effect of oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients? 3. What kinds of physiological positive effects can the NIOD and CPT provide on critically ill patients with COVID-19? 3. SIGNIFICANCE This study will provide valuable knowledge about secretion management in critically ill patients. It will also contribute to more efficient health care practice and resource utilization (i.e., physiotherapist). To be specific, NIOD could improve the respiratory management of patients with COVID-19. The findings acquired in this study can be generalizable to other hospitals and cohorts in ICUs. Ultimately, this could reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health system and could reduce the exposure of physiotherapists to COVID-19. 4. METHODS 4.1 Study Design The investigators will adopt a prospective crossover non-inferiority randomized design. 4.2 Setting Two ICUs in CHU Sainte Justine (Pediatric ICU) and Montreal General (Adult ICU) Hospital. 4.3 Screening of Eligible Patients and Informed Consent Procedure. When there is a potentially eligible patient, a research assistant will be notified in 24/7 during the study period. The investigators will obtain the informed consent (IC) from patients or parents/guardians using an informed consent form. 4.4 Eligible Patients Please see the other section of this application. 4.5 Intervention: Each subject will receive the NIOD (i.e., Frequencer) and the standardized CPT for this study. 4.5.1 Suctioning and Other Interventions As per each ICU's protocol, the participants will have a suction of secretion as needed. Any other potential interventions such as nebulization of hypertonic saline and bronchodilator and that with a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) can be given without any restrictions. 4.5.2 Positioning All the procedures (i.e., NIOD and CPT) will be applied with any positioning such as sitting and prone positions. Caregivers can also change the positioning as needed during the procedures. All the outcome parameters should be measured (before and after the procedures) with the same positioning. 4.5.3 Detailed Procedure NIOD will be implemented on four different parts of the chest walls, 3 minutes for each part and 12 minutes in total per each session. Left and right front and posterior chest walls will be stimulated, particularly, on the anterior chest, intercostal spaces 1-2 above nipple line and lateral side of the mid-clavicular line 1-2 below intercostal spaces. The intensity of the NIOD can be selected between 80-100%, which is pre-specified on the machine. The step-by-step procedure is described in the Appendix. 4.5.4 Selection of the Membrane There are several selections of the membrane available. The investigators will use the membrane according to the manual provided by the manufacture. 4.5.5 Standardization of the Procedure. The procedure using the NIOD will be standardized. The investigators will use a video clip (i.e., YouTube) and will ask each caregiver to view at least once before the first procedure of the day. 4.5.6 CPT. CPT will be defined as an assistant strike to the chest wall repeatedly with a cupped hand in specific places. CPT will be performed by a physiotherapist as per protocol in each institution. 4.6 Detailed Protocol Patients satisfying the eligibility criteria will have their baseline data collected prior to the intervention. Randomization Participants will be randomized into one of the 2 arms (NIOD first or CPT first). In the existing studies targeting adults, 20-60Hz are most widely used (personal communication with Dymedso Inc.). The investigators will apply 40Hz. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in CHU Sainte Justine (CHUSJ). Random allocation will be generated by an independent investigator in an equal number assigned to each intervention. Stratification will be applied for age (>18 years or =<18 years of age) and sites (CHUSJ and General Hospital) (Figure2). Timing of the Data Measurement The data measured in mechanical ventilation and patients monitor will be collected 1) right before the intervention being initiated, 2) 10 minutes after the end of the intervention, and 3) 30 min after each intervention finished. The investigators will manually record the following variables for the three timings (4.9.1). Vital sign values including EtCO2 waveforms from the beginning of the intervention until 30 min after the intervention will be extracted from the Electronic Medical Records (i.e., every minute) for the cohorts in CHUSJ. 4.7 Sample Size Calculation A trial aims to determine whether NIOD will be able to provide an improvement of oxygenation not inferior to standard CPT. The investigators estimate the mean improvement of SF ratio is 30 with a variance of 10 in CPT. It was claimed to be clinically non-inferior if effect of NIOD was 20% lower than the standard CPT. The largest clinically acceptable difference of 6 (30*0.20) is declared that NIOD is non-inferior compares with CPT. Type I, II error and ratio are set at 0.05, 0.1, and 1:1. With this, we require 32 cases in total (16 cases per group). Considering this, we will collect 25 cases per group (16-21). 4.8 Protocol Violation. Protocol violation in eligibility is defined as when a patient was randomized but does not follow the protocol. These patients will be excluded from the analyses. Patients who withdraw their consent after randomization will be excluded from the analyses. The number of excluded patients after randomization will be displayed in the CONSORT flow diagram (Fig3). Patients assigned to both arm receive the standard ICU care in each center. 4.9 Statistical Analyses The main analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. A patient who withdrew consent or patients with a protocol violation concerning eligibility are excluded from ITT analyses. Differences in patient characteristics between patients lost to follow-up and included patients will be assessed. In view of the non-inferiority study design, per-protocol (PP) analyses will also be performed. All subjects from the ITT population without protocol violations and deviations regarding treatment will be included in the PP population. The investigators will also repeat the analyses with logistic regression to consider that randomization was stratified by the participating center and age (>18 or =<18 years of age). Non-inferiority will be established if the lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence for the mean of SF ratio for CPT group relative to that of patients with NIOD exceeds the critical value corresponding to the absolute 5% margin below the observed proportion under usual care. All statistical analyses will be conducted with Stata (Stata Corp LP, TX USA) or other statistical software(s). 5. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1 Overview The device and membrane for adults applied have been certified and approved by Health Canada and commercially available in Canada (Fig1a). Although the prototype transducer for infants (Fig1b) has not been tested on patients as a large trial, the mechanism of the pressure delivery and the intensity of the delivering pressure/ oscillation should be similar as compared to the existing model for children and adult patients. The devices have been approved by Health Canada. The investigators believe there should be no excessive harm as compared to the current standard CPT. Patients will also receive standard CPT during the study period, which is widely accepted as a practice for airway clearance in the ICUs. This study will be approved by the Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Montreal, Canada. The study protocol will be registered into https://clinicaltrials.gov/ once it is approved by the local IRB. 5.2 Risk Minimization and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) It has shown that NIOD was feasible and well-tolerated in adult and relatively older children. For this study, another DSMB will be in place to independently supervise any potential side effects. It will include Francois Proulx MD and Tse Man Sze MD. The DSMB will follow the study completion and review any significant potential complications related to the intervention with NIOD. Any occurrence of pneumothorax, need for unplanned intubation, life-threatening event, during or in the 2 hours following the study, will be declared to and reviewed by the DSMB, which will independently decide on the need to stop or continue the study.",N/A

The neurotropism of the virus is assumed by its frequent association with neurological symptoms (anosmia, ageusia, headaches) but the extent of the central or peripheral nervous system involvement and the associated symptomatology remain poorly known for now. The main objective of this study is to describe the neurological and psychiatric manifestations occurring in the context of Covid-19 infection in patients hospitalized or followed-up in the APHP.SU hospital group. A better understanding of the neuropsychiatric impairment related to Covid-19 would improve the management of these patients in the acute phase, and knowledge of subsequent complications would allow adapting their rehabilitation and follow-up. The precise phenomenological description of these manifestations and the imaging, biology and neuropathology data will be compiled from the data collected by the physicians in charge of these patients as part of their inpatient or outpatient care. This study will also allow collecting unusual clinical manifestations from patients followed for neurological or psychiatric pathology in hospital departments and presenting a Covid-19 infection, in order to optimize the reorganization of their management, follow-up and rehabilitation in the epidemic context. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Pandemic context In December 2019, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection (Covid-19) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The virus quickly spread to other Chinese provinces and then to the rest of the world. The first cases in France were diagnosed on 23 January 2020 in patients who had been in China, and the number of cases rapidly increased to 100 confirmed cases on 29 February 2020. As of 16 April, 106,206 patients had been confirmed, 6,457 patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, and the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in hospital was 10,643 (government.fr). At the same date, more than 2,065,906 cases were confirmed worldwide, with more than 137,124 deaths (jhu.edu). The most commonly reported clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an infectious syndrome associated with respiratory signs. Neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19 To date, little is known about neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19. Some authors suggested a significant proportion of patients with central neurological manifestations such as headache, confusion, seizures or strokes. Some cases of COVID-19 encephalitis have also been reported: a case of acute haemorrhagic encephalitis, and a case of encephalitis with seizure and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the CSF. Neurological impairment of Covid-19 has been proposed as a contributing mechanism to respiratory failure in some patients with severe disease. Anosmia and ageusia are now recognized as common symptoms of the infection. Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and probable myelitis (without radiological confirmation) have also been described. Myalgia is frequently reported in patients with Covid-19 infection, but no cases of documented myopathy have been reported to date. Patients with Covid-19 infection may also present systemic encephalopathy in the context of severe respiratory failure, associated organ failure (renal, hepatic), and iatrogenicity. Patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for severe forms of the infection frequently present with confusion, and sometimes persistent cognitive disorders such as a dysexecutive syndrome, attention disorders, spatio-temporal disorientation. A high frequency of clinical signs of cortico-spinal bundle damage and leptomeningeal contrast images on cerebral MRI has also been reported. Regarding psychiatric manifestations, a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive syndromes was noted in patients with Covid-19. Post-traumatic stress disorder may also occur in these patients, particularly those who have suffered from severe forms of stress and have been hospitalized in intensive care units. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family and bears a strong similarity to other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Clinical and preclinical knowledge of other coronaviruses suggests neurotropism of viruses of this family. In particular, infection with SARS-CoV-2 or NCoV-OC43 may cause encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. The SARS-CoV-2 virus adheres to cell membranes by interaction with ACE2 receptors, which are highly expressed on the surfaces of neurons and glial cells. The ACE2 receptor is particularly expressed in the brainstem and in regions involved in cardiovascular control including the paraventricular nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract. The virus could reach the nervous system via systemic circulation (viremia) or via ethmoidal microcirculation via the olfactory epithelium. Indeed, animal studies have shown that SARS-Cov can invade the brain via the olfactory epithelium via the nasal route and cause neuronal death. The virus could also infect the brain through trans-synaptic transmission from the olfactory epithelium through the ethmoidal floor to the olfactory bulb. Another mechanism of neurological damage related to Covid-19 infection could be the initiation of an immune reaction with the release of cytokines and other inflammatory proteins, leading to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which amplifies neuro-inflammatory processes. Systemic inflammation and cytokines may also promote ischemic stroke. Severe coagulopathies have been reported. Covid-19 and pre-existing neurological and psychiatric disorders SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to the aggravation of certain pre-existing neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the potential impact of the infection in the short, medium and long term on these pathologies is still unknown. Indeed, infections are a classic aggravating factor in many neurological pathologies, such as autoimmune pathologies, metabolic pathologies, and also neurodegenerative pathologies. Brain inflammation is recognised as an important mechanism of neurodegenerative pathologies and has also been implicated in psychiatric pathologies such as schizophrenia and depression. Patients with cardiac or respiratory damage, particularly in the context of neuro-muscular pathologies, could particularly develop severe forms of infection. Patients with neurodegenerative pathologies often represent an elderly population, and therefore also at risk of severe forms of infection. Patients followed for inflammatory or neuro-oncological pathologies and undergoing immunosuppressive treatments or chemotherapy also represent a at-risk population. SARS-CoV-2 infection could also worsen certain psychiatric pathologies. Public interest research Neurological and psychiatric manifestations have been reported in patients with Covid-19 but the different neuropsychiatric expressions of Covid-19 infections are currently not well characterized. A better understanding of the neurological and psychiatric impairment related to Covid-19 could improve management of the patients in the acute phase. Knowledge of neurological and psychiatric complications subsequently occurring would allow adapting the follow-up of these patients. The inclusion of prospective long-term follow-up data is crucial in the overall understanding of the neuropsychiatric disorders of Covid-19. Neurological complications are likely to occur at a distance from the infection or to be lately diagnosed, for instance, in patients who have been in intensive care. The collection of data from the rehabilitation follow-up of these patients is crucial in this context. The precise phenomenological description of these manifestations and the collection of imaging, biological and neuropathological data may also allow establishing hypotheses on the pathophysiology of the neurological damage caused by Covid-19. The impact of Covid-19 infection on pre-existing neurological and psychiatric pathologies is not known.

The study is a multicenter trial which will be carried out on different sites in France. This trial is retrospective and will analyze the data collected during treatment. ***  *** Detailed Description *** COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes significant morbidity and mortality. There is currently no approved treatment for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Global efforts to evaluate new antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. To quickly propose a first line of defense and fight against the virus in hospitalized patients, the World Health Organization (WHO) relies on already existing drugs, ""repositioned"", which are immediately available in large quantities and present a good security profile. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a broad spectrum nucleotide analogue that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity among a diverse group of RNA viruses. Non-clinical and clinical data suggest that remdesivir may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19. WHO has identified remdesivir as a candidate drug of interest to be studied in clinical trials. Compassionate provision of the drug allowed its use before clinical trials began. This retrospective cohort study is designed to analyze the data collected during the routine care of patients who have benefited from this compassionate provision. The data collected in real life during care will allow a multivariate analysis quickly providing elements of response on a typology of patients and level of progression of the disease for which remdesivir would bring a more or less significant clinical benefit. Multivariate analysis of these data will allow the identification of variables at the initiation of treatment with remdesivir that are potentially predictive of its clinical efficacy. The period for collecting data collected during treatment for an individual subject is 30 days. The retrospective collection begins on the day before initiation of treatment with remdesivir up to 29 days after. A note of information and of no objection to the collection of data will be sent to the patient. The data collected comes from the patient's medical records. The observations will be entered by investigative doctors and or clinical study technicians. Statistical analysis will be carried out using SAS 9.3 and / or R software. All the analyzes carried out will follow the recommendations of STROBE for observational studies. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be carried out before basic freezing and data analysis. Quantitative data will be described as the mean and standard deviation or medians and quartiles depending on the distribution of the data. Qualitative data will be described in terms of numbers and percentages. Comparisons of quantitative data will be analyzed using the student or wilcoxon test depending on the test application conditions, and comparisons of categorical variables will be made using the Chi2 or Fisher test, if appropriate. Multivariate models will be produced to explore the factors associated with patient prognosis. The clinical development of patients described on a 7-point ordinal scale will be divided into two in order to create logistic models. The entire process of selecting variables in the models will be described in the analysis plan which will be validated before the database freezes.",N/A

Crude mortality in Spain is 9.2%. However, the causes of death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are unknown. To date, no treatment has been shown to be effective for the 2019-SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended. Supportive care and isolation are recommended for infected individuals. Currently, observational studies on critically ill patients with COVID-19 have small samples. The objective is to evaluate the incidence of mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 disease in this group of critically ill patients, as well as the risk factors associated with mortality and the effectiveness of the treatments used compassionately. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease as an international alarm public health emergency. This ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 disease is devastating, despite widespread implementation of control measures, which is creating a challenge for national healthcare. Since the beginning of the epidemic until the date of this project, more than 800,000 cases have been detected in the world, of which almost 214,000 have been detected in Spain. The results of the recent analysis of clinical characteristics in a selected cohort of 1,099 COVID-19 patients throughout China have shown that up to 15% (173 / 1,099) developed severe disease according to the American Thoracic clinical criteria for severe community pneumonia. Society, and of these seriously ill patients, 20.6% presented as admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) (33/173, 19%), or the use of mechanical ventilation, both invasive and non-invasive. invasive (81/173, 46%) or death (14/173, 8%). In a retrospective study that included 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from the Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), a 28-day mortality rate of 61% was found, although the causes of death of the patients included were not reported. Nowaday, the crude mortality in Europe is 5.4% of reported cases, although it is important to be noted that this calculation is subject to multiple notification biases and due to the different diagnostic test policies in the countries, and probable differences in healthcare and demographic models between countries. Similarly, in Spain, mortality with 213,024 cases notified to the National Surveillance Network is 10.4%. Using modeling, a mortality has been estimated among hospitalized cases that could reach 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9% -32%). However, the mortality and causes of death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Spain are still unknown. To date, no specific antiviral treatment that has been shown to be effective for the 2019-SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended. Symptomatic and supportive care, along with respiratory and contact isolation, are recommended for infected individuals. Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) is a prophylactic treatment for critically ill patients, mainly requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, based on an oropharyngeal paste and an enteral suspension containing antimicrobials (usually tobramycin, colistin, and an antifungal) and an intravenous antibiotic (usually a cephalosporin. second generation), administered during the first 4 days of ICU treatment. The goal of SDD is to prevent or eradicate, if present, the abnormal, oropharyngeal and intestinal transport of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as aerobic gram-negative bacilli (AGNB), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, in patients at risk of nosocomial infections. In critically ill patients, it has been demonstrated with a high level of evidence, that SDD prevents serious infections and reduces mortality. In an observational study in two hospitals in China, 51% of the patients developed a hospital-acquired infection and this incidence was associated with an increase in mortality. Therefore, the preventive strategy of SDD could be postulated as an alternative to reduce mortality and the incidence of infections in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, this hypothesis has not been evaluated at the moment. At the present time, observational studies focused on the clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the factors associated with their mortality have small sample sizes, making knowledge of the epidemiology of critically ill patients clearly insufficient. And what is more relevant, this scenario of lack of knowledge, when extrapolated to the situation of the current outbreak in Spain, places us in the need to describe the epidemiological manifestations of the COVI-19 in Spain in order to handle with safety and efficiency the challenge of the control and treatment of the outbreak in Spain of the COVID-19. Specifically, the study will focus on critically ill patients with COVID-19 for two reasons: They represent the cohort of patients with the highest use of material and professional resources in the health system. Given the current moment of pandemic and healthcare challenge, it is therefore pertinent to conduct an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 disease to reliably define the incidence of mortality and morbidity in this group of patients, as well as the risk factors for infection by SARS-CoV-2 associated with mortality. Objective The main objective is to evaluate the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, as well as to analyze the factors associated with mortality. The secondary objectives: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Spain. To describe the usual clinical practice in the ICU of critically ill adult patients with COVID-19, to identify risk patterns and possible effectiveness or adverse effects of the treatments received. To compare the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with SDD compared with those who do not received SDD. To describe the cause of death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 received invasive mechanical ventilation. Method Design: An observational, prospective and multicenter study will be carry out, envolving of 12 ICUs in Madrid (University Hospital of Getafe, as coordinating center; University Hospital Puerta de Hierro, University Hospital del Henares of Coslada, University Hospital of Torrejón, Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Hospital Infanta Cristina, Hospital del Tajo, Hospital Quirón Madrid Sanchinarro, Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Hospital Universitario de Móstoles, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, and Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona). Inclusion criteria: patients over 18 years of age who are admitted to the ICU with the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Recruitment period: The study will start once the study has been approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Hospital Universitario de Getafe with an expected date of April 2020, with an estimated duration of 3 months. Case definition: Any critically ill patients with a positive respiratory tract sample result (tracheal aspirate or nasopharyngeal exudate) using the PCR technique for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and requiring admission to the ICU at trial will be considered a confirmed case of COVID-19 of the physician in charge of the patient. Data collection: Demographic variables: age, sex, reason for admission to the ICU. Comorbidities: severity at ICU admission (SAPSIII); Daily SOFA until day 7, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other chronic lung diseases (interstitial lung disease), chronic kidney failure, previous liver disease (cirrhosis), immunosuppression, previous heart disease (ischemic, valvular), chronic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation); previous cerebrovascular disease (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Noninvasive respiratory support prior to ICU admission: non-invasive ventilation, or high flow therapy with nasal cannula, and duration of non-invasive respiratory support. Invasive respiratory support parameters during the first 7 days: tidal volume, level of positive end-expiratory pressure, plateau pressure, inspiratory fraction of oxygen. Biochemistry values and arterial blood gases, blood count and coagulation parameters on admission to the ICU during the first 7 days from ICU admission. Pharmacological therapies received for COVID-19 disease during the ICU stay: azitromycin, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, antiretrovirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), tocilizumab, oseltamivir, darunabir, remdesivir, baricitinib. Bacterial / fungal infections acquired in the ICU (pneumonia, bacteriemia): isolated microorganisms in diagnostic samples, isolated microorganisms in surveillance samples (oropharynx and rectum if surveillance samples are available); antibiotic treatment. Ventilatory management: prone positioning, administration of inhaled nitric oxide, performance of tracheostomy, date of tracheotomy, modality of tracheotomy (surgical, percutaneous). Classification of predefined causes of death: Refractory hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry less than 80%, or PaO2 <60 mmHg of arterial blood sample) despite maximum ventilatory support (FiO2 100%, PEEP level> 5 cm H2O) with maintenance MAP> 60 mmHg in the 3 hours prior to exitus lethalis. Refractory shock (mean arterial pressure less than 60 mmHg despite vasoactive support with norepinephrine at> 2 mcg / kg / min and / or dobutamine at> 20 microgr / kg / min, and serum lactate level> 2 mmol / L in the 3 hours prior to exitus lethalis), associated or not with organ failure, but with peripheral oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry greater than 90%, with no evidence of documented infection in the previous 48 hours. Septic shock. A refractory shock which fulfill previous criteria plus the presence of a documented infection in the 48 hours prior to exitus lethalis. Others: Pulmonary thromboembolism (defined based on clinical suspicion, associated with any of the classifications [Wells or Geneva] according to the low, intermediate or high probability and the determination of the high D-dimer (> 500 μg/L) in the 24 hours prior to exitus lethalis; Incohercible bleeding; Yatrogenic respiratory complications (accidental exit of the orotracheal tube with impossibility of obtaining an artificial airway, fatal obstruction of the orotracheal tube); Arrhythmias: sudden unanticipated onset of malignant arrhythmias (irreversible ventricular fibrillation), or asystole. Arrhythmias appearing during the last minutes before exitus lethalis will be excluded. Main outcomes. ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes: appearance of nosocomial infections during ICU admission (ventilator-associated pneumonia , nosocomial pneumonia, catheter-related bacteremia, bacteraemia); development of complications during ICU admission (development of acute respiratory distress, barotrauma, development of organ failure [cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, hematological]), duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, withdrawald of life support, and cause of mortality. Statistic analysis. Given the estimated mortality of 40% of the cases hospitalized in the ICU, a convenience sample size of 600 participants will be estimated. Considering a loss of 15% for the outcomes, 750 subjects will finally be included. To evaluate the risk factors associated with the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19, a logistic model adjusted for baseline variables (age, severity at ICU admission), empirical treatment received, failure of non-invasive respiratory support will be performed. The effectiveness of empirical treatments for COVID-19 will be performed through logistic analysis adjusted for age, severity at admission and complications during ICU admission. In addition, a stratified cluster analysis will be proposed for ICUs that apply the SDD strategy and units that do not routinely use SDD. Data quality. The data will be reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee of the study and validated by the collaborating researcher responsible for each center. All data will be centrally reviewed. Alerts will be sent for lost data, aberrant data or discrepancies thereof. At each center, local study investigators will review data from 5% of randomly selected participants, and all participants about whom evaluators may have questions about inconsistent data. The data collection of all included cases will be verified by an independent research coordinator hired through an external CRO and who will evaluate the quality of data collection independently of the main researcher. Data collection will be re-evaluated until the forms and all results are completed. Full data will be required to include subjects in the final analysis, and only subjects without missing data will be accepted for the primary variables or patients with missing data less than 10% for the secondary variables, if these cannot be retrieved by the investigators. All bizarre data will be sent to the reference centers for verification. The presence of missing data in the main variables will be reason for the exclusion of the participant in the analysis. Ethical-legal aspects. The study will be carried out in accordance with the updated Helsinki declaration in its latest version. The study protocol, together with the data collection sheets and Annexes will be sent for approval to the Ethics and Research Committee of the University Hospital of Getafe, and will ask them for a waiver consent due to the characteristics of the study design (non-intervention study for statistical purposes, action plan to improve the quality of care, in a health emergency situation), as provided in the spanish laws. This study does not include any control group. Participation in this study does not imply any risk for the included patients since it is based on the usual clinical practice in common use in all hospitals, which are already applied at the Getafe University Hospital. The study will be based on the Spanish legislation for biomedical research, and in accordance with national laws of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of them that the identity of the subject will be kept confidential and anonymous throughout the study, in such a way that no personal data will be collected that allows the identification of the subjects included and only the data necessary to achieve the study objectives will be collected. Confidentiality The use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the document is not authorized in any way without the written consent of the Steering Committee. Given that the study proposes the analysis of the usual clinical practice, it is considered not pertinent to contract a civil liability insurance, since it is a low-intensity clinical study. During the period of inclusion of the participants, the database to which only the study coordinating team (principal investigator and co-investigators) will have access will be generated anonymously, with irreversible dissociation of personal data.",N/A

While most people with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen support and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, sepsis and septic shock, multiorgan failure, including acute kidney, liver and cardiac injury. ARDS REHABILITATION Critically ill people who undergo prolonged mechanical ventilation often develop weakness, with severe symmetrical weakness of and deconditioning of the proximal musculature and of the respiratory muscles (critical illness neuropathy/myopathy).These individuals also develop significant functional impairment and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL) up to 2 and 5 years after discharge. ARDS survivors may complain of depression, anxiety, memory disturbances, and difficulty with concentration often unchanged at 2 and 5 years. Less than half of all ARDS survivors return to work within the first year following discharge, two-thirds at two years, and more than 70% at five years. Early physiotherapy (PT) of people with ARDS has recently been suggested as a complementary therapeutic tool to improve early and late outcomes. The aims of PT programs should be to reduce complications of immobilization and ventilator-dependency, to improve residual function, to prevent new hospitalisations, and to improve health status and HRQL. Physiotherapy in critical patients is claimed also to prevent and contribute to treat respiratory complications such as secretion retention, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Early mobilization and maintenance of muscle strength may reduce the risk of difficult weaning, limited mobility, and ventilator dependency. Lastly, pulmonary rehabilitation in ICU in mechanically ventilated subjects may reduce length of stay in ICU up to 4.5 day, shorten mechanical ventilation of 2.3 days and weaning by 1.7 days. The aim of this study is to investigate how early pulmonary and motor rehabilitation impacts on length of hospital admission (ICU and acute ward) and early and late outcomes inpatients that develop ARDS due to COVID-19. ***  *** Detailed Description *** People that develop ARDS due to COVID-19 and requiring admission to ICU (both invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation) will be enrolled. Two tertiary referral centers, part of the same region (Veneto) but located in different cities, will recruit participants. ICU standard of care is the same as defined by regional and national guidelines; rehabilitation in ICU COVID-19 subjects is provided only in one center due to local technical and organizational limitations. Non contamination between centers is possible due to restrictions of mobility and strict admission criteria based on catchment area. Early physiotherapy treatment will start from the day of admission. Baseline measurement of physical function will performed using the Physical Function in ICU Test (PFIT). The PFIT is a submaximal exercise test that was developed for patients in the ICU who may not be able to mobilize away from the bedside. Participants will start rehabilitation if they will not experiment one of the following conditions or should cease exercise because of the following (see exclusion criteria). Rehabilitation Intervention Rehabilitation program will start at admission in ICU. The program is based on the clinical characteristics of the individual to be treated. Participants will commence a hierarchical, standardized protocol that includes functional, respiratory and strength training. If participants will be unable to sit out of bed, assisted active exercises will be performed in bed. Exercise training will be provided for 15 minutes 3 times/day, 6 days per week. Intensity of strength training: Until fatigue (Borg Scale) Type of strength training: >Grade 3 Medical Research Council (MRC) strength, active to resisted; <Grade 3 MRC strength, active assist to active Repetitions for strength training: Start 5 repetitions each limb, Progress to 3 sets of 10 repetitions as able Functional retraining: Sit-to-stand (using tilt table or standing walker if unable), rolling, supine to sitting, trunk control/balance Motor program - Intubated patient Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) >8: passive mobilisation; postural positioning Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 (weaning): passive and active-assist mobilisation; postural positioning - Weaned off patient Non-invasively ventilated/O2 high fluxes - If strength < 3 MRC: passive and/or active-assist; tentative functional retraining - If strength ≥3 MRC: active-assist and active; strength training; functional retraining Pulmonary Rehabilitation - Intubated patient Glasgow Coma Scale >8: postural positioning Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 (weaning): postural positioning, cautious inspiratory muscle training - Weaned off patient Non-invasively ventilated/O2 high fluxes - If strength < 3 MRC: postural positioning, positive pressure expiration exercise, cautious inspiratory muscle training - If strength ≥3 MRC: postural positioning, positive pressure expiration exercise, inspiratory muscle training The intensity of exercise will prescribed based on the results of the PFIT.

This project aims to evaluate a new camera-based system for contactless measurement of vital signs as well as an artificial intelligence (AI) predicting hospitalization or death within 30 days. This particular study will evaluate the new system's ability without interfering with standard care of the patient. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background and aim: The vital signs are critical in assessing the severity and prognosis of infections, i.e., Covid-19, influenza, sepsis and pneumonia. Quick and accurate triage is critical when facing a pandemic with an overwhelming number of cases (confirmed and suspected). This study aims a) to evaluate a new method for rapid camera-based non-contact measurement of five vital signs; body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, and b) if an AI can predict hospitalization or death within 30 days. Methods: A method-comparison study design is used comparing each vital sign measured with the new method to the corresponding standard reference method. Furthermore, a cohort design is used to follow up any hospitalization or death within 30 days. The investigated new system consists of a high-speed digital video camera, a digital radiometric infrared camera, LED lights and a computer for data recording. This system faces the subject at a distance of approximately one meter, capturing a 30 second recording of the subject's face. First, all vital signs will be measured using one set of reference devices. Secondly the investigated device will record a 30 second video of the patient's face. Thirdly, and last, all vital signs will be measured using the same set of reference devices. A copy of the vital sign readings (using the standard reference methods) will be handed over by an investigator to the clinical professionals responsible for the subsequent medical care for each subject. Afterwards, the collected 30-second recordings will be run through specific software algorithms to extract the vital signs. The results from the new camera-based contactless measurement of vital signs and the outcome of the AIs prediction of risk for hospitalization or death will not be presented in the care situation of the patient. Expected Findings: It is expected that the proposed study will show that the new method can estimate body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, and blood pressure with an acceptable agreement compared with the reference method and also estimate hospitalization or death within 30 days. Implications of the expected findings: Being able to measure vital signs quicker than before by using a new contactless method would greatly facilitate triage of large number of patients. Also being able to predict hospitalization or increased risk for death would further improve the triage of patients.",N/A

Trials are in progress of cytokine inhibition and other immune modulation to treat COV-HI. This proposal aims to use a rapidly executed cohort study to characterise the clinical phenotypes of COV-HI in patients in the UK through an established and nimble network of clinicians and scientists with broad experience of identifying and treating HI. The aim is to confirm the COV-HI clinical phenotype and using routine data to try to infer the inflexion point where COV-HI emerges. This would enable refinement of the proposed treatment algorithm and translates to routine clinical practice to improve the outlook for COV-HI. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Early information from the UK ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre)- COVID-19 Study Case Mix Programme Database 27 March 2020 report that critical care unit admissions with COVID-19 totaled 775 patients of whom 79 patients have died, 86 patients were discharged alive from critical care and 609 patients were last reported as still being in critical care. It is imperative to reduce this high death rate. Emerging evidence from China, Italy and the US suggests that in a small subset of patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease there is a hyperinflammatory syndrome (COV-HI), which may be contributing to the high mortality and morbidity. Terminology regarding hyperinflammation is heterogenous. When caused by genetic abnormalities in children it is called primary or familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH). Secondary HLH (sHLH) is a hyperinflammatory process driven by infection, rheumatic disorders and malignancy (usually lymphoproliferative disorders). sHLH is termed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) when associated with rheumatic disease, macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS) in sepsis, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following immune effector cell therapies (haplo-identical allogeneic stem cell transplantation or CAR-T cell therapy). It is likely that such hyperinflammatory states lie on a spectrum and collectively the clinical phenomenon has been called cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) or hyperinflammation (HI). Current diagnostic criteria for HI are based on fHLH (HLH-2004 guidelines) and the H score (a weighted composite generating a probability). Recently published management algorithms in adults are based on consensus expert opinion and clinical experience, extrapolated from paediatric literature in fHLH. The HLH Across-speciality Collaboration (HASC) is a 162-strong group of clinicians/scientists who specialize in the management of patients with hyperinflammation. HASC member include Rheumatologists, Haematologists, Intensivists, Infectious Disease specialists, Immunologists, Virologists, Nephrologists and Gatroenterologists from both adult and paediatric backgrounds. Members of HASC have led the set-up of multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTs) to raise awareness of and manage hyperinflammatory illness, completed national audits to demonstrate hyperinflammation is often missed and have set up HLH registries and bioresources (https://research.ncl.ac.uk/ukhr/). COVID-19 hyperinflammation (COV-HI): rationale for treatment and summary of available evidence In COVID-19 respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. ARDS is a late pre-terminal event in these patients but there is a reported clinical phenotype of severe COVID-19 where hyperinflammation complicates the respiratory failure, termed here COVID-19 hyperinflammation or COV-HI. A cytokine profile resembling sHLH (a variant of HI) is associated with COVID-19 disease severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL), -2, -6 -7, -8 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-ginducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α and tumour necrosis factor-α[i]. Predictors of fatality from two recent retrospective, multi-centre studies of confirmed COVID-19 cases included elevated ferritin, c reactive protein (CRP) and serum IL-6. In the first study of 150 confirmed cases, the mean ferritin was 1297.6 ng/ml in non-survivors (n=68) versus 614.0 ng/ml in survivors (n=82); p<0.001) 9. Subsequently in 193 confirmed cases, the mean ferritin was 1453 ng/ml in non-survivors (n=54) versus 503 ng/ml in survivors (n=137) (p<0.0001). Ferritin >300ng/ml (p=0.0038) and raised IL-6 (p=0.0080) were both associated with in-hospital death. Data publicly available on MedRciv demonstrates that in a retrospective study of 100 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, disease activity correlated with parameters known to be elevated in HLH, including IL-6 (p<0.001) and ferroprotein (p<0.001). Publicly available data on Chinaciv of 21 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab (anti-IL6 blockade), demonstrated that all patients became afebrile within 24 hours of treatment. In this study following tocilizumab treatment there was a reduction of oxygen requirement (15/20 patients), resolution of CT lesions (19/21 patients), normalization of lymphocyte count (10/19 patients), reduction of CRP levels (16/19 patients) and hospital discharge (19/21 patients) with an average hospitalization duration of 13.5 days. There were no adverse events attributable to tocilizumab. Personal communication from the investigators in Italy and treating physicians within the UK, has confirmed clinical benefit using tocilizumab in a group phenotypically in the COV-HI group, without overt adverse event. Trials are opening internationally using tocilizumab in the COV-HI group. IL-1 is central to the hypercytokinaemia in HLH. Off-licence anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is recommended in treatment algorithms for HLH. There are active trials looking at the role of anakinra (see for example https://www.sobi.com/sites/default/files/pr/202003183346-1.pdf) and tocilizumab (see for example http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=494090) in the management of COV-HI patients and insertion of cytokine inhibitor arms into the adaptive platform REMAP CAP (https://www.remapcap.org). There is increasingly reported anecdotal experience of successful use of tocilizumab and anakinra in COV-HI and scientific rationale for plausibility. Taken together, these findings suggest that high mortality may be due to virally-driven hyperinflammation in COVID-19 (COV-HI), that could be identified with routinely available clinical and laboratory data. Of particular note are C-reactive protein - CRP a surrogate for IL-6 - and ferritin, both tested in general medical assessment of unwell patients. Outcome could be improved if the COV-HI phenotype can be characterised; such phenotyping will inform trial design (in which HASC members are heavily involved) as well as identifying patients in hospitals overwhelmed by clinical cases who can be recruited to those trials. In particular, understanding the clinical course of those admitted to hospital (who by definition have severe COVID-19 and are at risk of COV-HI) and the inflexion point at which COV-HI emerges would enable targeted treatment. Such characterisation of phenotype is currently not available but HASC have mobilised the UK network to collect the data to inform this gap in the evidence. Identifying people who, at the point of needing respiratory support, could potentially benefit from immune modulation may be possible by interrogating continuous clinical & laboratory data collected from hospital admission to the time of recovery/death. This will be a retrospective cohort study. Due to the urgent nature of this research and the need to rapidly gather information about each patient's clinical experience and outcome during the COVID-19 pandemic it will not be possible to gain informed written consent. It is proposed to: 1. Collect demographic information on consecutive people admitted to selected sites across the UK (initially UCLH, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield) with COVID-19 starting with the institution's first case. Hospital admission is proxy for severe COVID 19. Map their clinical journey by collecting serial clinical and laboratory data from routine clinical investigations during the course of their illness at 24-hour intervals 2. Retrospectively analyse data to try to identify patients who subsequently fit the COV-HI phenotype. Look in detail at these cases to understand whether there is an inflexion point early in their disease course such that a point for intervention with immune modulation could be have been made. It will be important to differentiate between people deteriorating due to organ failure because of co-morbidity and poor reserve, compared to those with overwhelming inflammatory response fitting with the proposed hypothesis. For the former group, the risk associated with immune modulation is likely to outweigh the benefit. 3. Use data collection to define criteria that could be used as threshold for treatment De-identified data will be accessed by all members of the team who have contributed their patients to the study and to collaborators within the UK for statistical analysis. Patient age will be retained in the de-identified data as this is an essential clinical variable but NHS number, DOB, ICNARC number and date of admission will not be visible to members of the team who are not the normal care team of a given patient. The risk of identification of a patient from their age and diagnosis alone is very low. Everyone with access to person-identifiable information will hold an NHS contract or honorary contract and have received necessary training regarding GDPR and Good Clinical Practice, and will be fully aware of their responsibilities to patient confidentiallity. Understand and comply with the law. This has been set up as a research study using project specific data stored on the REDCap platform at Newcastle University.

The host-pathogen relationships and the physiopathological mechanisms underlying the clinical aggravation of COVID-19 patients remain misunderstood. The project aim is to create a prospective cohort of biological samples collected from well characterized COVID-19 patients. This project aims first to identify based on these samples an early immune signature predictive of clinical worsening of COVID-19 patients in order to improve their management, and secondarily to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the different phases of the disease in order to identify innovative therapeutic targets and vaccine perspectives. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared pandemic the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the causative severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2). People infected with SARS-CoV-2 vary in severity from being asymptomatic to having severe pneumonia and ARDS. Predictive markers of clinical worsening after admission are lacking. Clinical deterioration often coincides with the development of host antiviral immune responses, suggesting that the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may underpin COVID-19 pathogenesis leading to aberrant and excessive immune responses causing lung functional disability. Relevant therapeutic strategies are still under investigation. Based on a better understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, the identification of predictive biomarkers early in the disease process would be of outstanding interest to tailor prompt therapeutic interventions. On this basis, the project aims to create a prospective cohort of biological samples collected from COVID-19 patients followed at the Toulouse University Hospital. This cohort will collect and cryopreserve biological samples (33 mL), including plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), on admission (day 0) and longitudinally (day 4, 8 12 and in discharge) and will allow us to investigate our primary and secondary objectives. This cohort will be bridged with a clinical cohort in order to have a very well-defined population of COVID-19 patients with the following outcomes: - Patients with severe disease requiring on admission intensive care unit (ICU) management for ARDS, - Non-severe hospitalized patients with secondary clinical worsening requiring ICU management, - Non-severe hospitalized patients without clinical worsening requiring ICU management. In addition, mildly symptomatic patients among healthcare workers attending outpatient dedicated clinics will be recruited and blood samples will be collected on their first consultation and 10 to 14 days later in the frame of a medical surveillance program.",N/A

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. While a proportion of people with COVID-19 have sufficiently severe symptoms to require hospitalization at the time of initial symptom onset, in others the disease may remain mild, and in some cases there has been observed a worsening of symptoms a few days after initial presentation with relatively mild symptoms. There is an urgent need for understanding the progression of disease for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 who do not require immediate hospitalization. This is an international, observational cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 who have been assessed as not requiring hospitalization (outpatients). This study will also be a platform for the screening of outpatients for randomized trials that will be conducted by the INSIGHT group. Adults who seek testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be screened following consent. Those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will form an observational cohort study and be followed for 28 days.

Older Veterans and those with high blood pressure, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome (abnormal cholesterol and resistance to insulin's effects) are particularly at risk for HFpEF. However, it is not clear why only some Veterans in this risk group eventually develop HFpEF. Extensive information from experimental animal models and some human studies suggests that dietary patterns in vulnerable 'salt-sensitive' people could contribute to the risk for HFpEF. Reducing salt intake and increasing overall dietary quality in at-risk Veterans could prevent heart and blood vessel damage that ultimately leads to HFpEF. Reducing the development of HFpEF, which currently has no definitive treatment, is highly relevant to the VA's mission to emphasize prevention of disease and population health. ***  *** Detailed Description *** COVID-19 in-person visit hold - screening but not actively consenting Patients with heart failure (HF) account for over 1,200,000 VA outpatient visits per year, and HF remains the most common cause for hospital admission in the VA. Approximately 1/3 of Veterans with HF have 'preserved' ejection fraction (HFpEF), or relatively normal contractile function of the heart; such patients suffer functional decline and poor quality of life, and half die within 5 years after diagnosis. Risk factors for developing HFpEF are more common in Veterans than the general population, and the burden of HFpEF to the VA system will rise in the years ahead as these Veterans age. Preventive efforts are critical, but are hampered by gaps in knowledge related to HFpEF pathophysiology. The long term goal of this proposal is to prevent the onset of HFpEF in at-risk Veterans. Hypertension (HTN) confers the highest population-attributable risk for HFpEF, particularly when accompanied by the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Animal models of HTN and metabolic syndrome develop HFpEF due to microvascular oxidative stress and inflammation induced by high sodium intake. Recent data from cardiac biopsies confirm similar mechanisms in human HFpEF. Dietary sodium restriction is widely recommended to prevent HTN-associated heart disease in humans, but this advice is now controversial. Few studies have examined how individual differences in response to sodium intake affect risk. ""Salt-sensitive"" persons have blood pressure (BP) that changes in parallel with sodium intake, and commonly develop cardiovascular abnormalities associated with HFpEF. The overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate salt-sensitivity as a novel, diet-responsive risk factor for incident HFpEF in Veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis is that the sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating pattern will improve cardiovascular functional and structural risk factors for HFpEF in Veterans with the salt-sensitive phenotype. Guided by findings in experimental models, cohort studies, and strong preliminary evidence from the investigators' research group, this hypothesis will be tested in a two-phase study and by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine effects of DASH/SRD on functional and structural cardiovascular HFpEF risk factors in salt-sensitive vs. salt-resistant Veterans, 2) measure the effect of an electronically-delivered tailored-messaging intervention on DASH/SRD adherence, and 3) determine effects of DASH/SRD intervention and adoption on microvascular function and assess the endothelial glycocalyx as a biomarker of cardiovascular response to DASH/SRD. Phase 1 of the study is a crossover-randomized comparison of DASH/SRD vs. control diet for two weeks each, and Phase 2 a 6-month extension to promote DASH/SRD adherence. The salt-sensitive phenotype will be defined by between-diet changes in 24-hour mean BP during Phase 1. In Phase 2, the efficacy of motivational interviewing-based counseling and the Women's and Men's Hypertension Experiences and Emerging Lifestyles Intervention (WHEELS-I), a tailored messaging program, to sustain DASH/SRD adherence, will be compared. Echocardiography and arterial tonometry will be used to assess HFpEF-related cardiovascular parameters during short- and longer-term dietary modification and their interaction with salt-sensitivity. In vivo microscopy and novel blood testing will assess microvascular function and the integrity of the endothelial glycocalyx, a blood vessel lining that is sodium-responsive and may mediate the adverse effects of salt-sensitivity. This proposal is innovative because it represents the first study to examine salt-sensitivity as a factor promoting HFpEF in Veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome, the highest risk group for incident HFpEF. Moreover, it aims to link microvascular dysfunction, an important pathway in human HFpEF, with endothelial glycocalyx damage, a potential biomarker for sodium-mediated vascular risk. The proposed research is significant because it will vertically advance the investigators' understanding of how dietary factors contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF, a major and growing health threat to Veterans.",N/A

Diagnosis relies on the identification of viral RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but its positivity can be delayed. A series based on 1014 chinese patients reported higher sensitivity for CT, with a mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results of 5.1 ± 1.5 days (PMID: 32101510). Moreover, obtaining RT-PCR results requires several hours, which is problematic for patients triage. Chest CT can allow early depiction of COVID-19, especially when performed more than 3 days after symptoms onset. It is important to distinguish between COVID-19 and bacterial causes of pulmonary infection, which requires expertise in thoracic imaging. Thus, it is important to identify reliable CT diagnostic criteria based on visual assessment, and also develop deep-learning based solutions for early positive diagnosis which could be used by less experienced readers, in a context of large epidemic. Several risk factors for poor outcome are already identified, such as older age, comorbidities, or an elevated d-dimer level at presentation (PMID: 32171076). Extensive CT abnormalities are linked to poor outcome, but some patients secondarily worsen despite non extensive abnormalities at first assessment, highlighting the need for worsening prediction based on initial imaging findings. Lastly, there is currently no drug with a proven efficacy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, who for management relies on mechanical ventilation and supportive care. Some hypothesized that Remdesivir, an antiviral therapy could be effective (PMID: 32147516), with ongoing randomized trials conducted in China and the US. Automated tools allowing quantifying the disease extent on CT would be desirable in order to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. Building a large dataset of CT images is needed for identification of accurate CT criteria and development of deep learning-based solutions for diagnosis, quantification and prognostic estimation. The aim of this project is three fold: (i) create a multi-centric open database repository on CT scans relative to COVID-19, (ii) create a multi-expert annotation protocol with different level of annotations depicting the severity of the disease, (iii) allow the development of non-proprietary computer aided solutions (academia & industry) for automatic quantification of the diseases and prognosis through the use of the latest advances in the field of artificial intelligence. For patients, the validation of reliable diagnostic criteria will allow early detection of the disease, and better distinction with other potential cause of acute respiratory symptoms, requiring a specific treatment, such as bacterial bronchopneumonia. It will contribute to a standardization of care as well as an equal access to diagnosis and treatment for the ensemble of the population. Public health benefit will be an access to CT diagnosis of COVID-19 independently from the availability of local expertise in thoracic imaging. The possibility to anticipate the need for ventilation, based on the developed CT severity scores, will also positively impact the management of patients in particular in the context of a massive flow of patients as expected at the epidemic peak. This project will allow evaluating the proportion of patients likely to present respiratory sequelae, based on the severity and extent of lung abnormalities at the acute phase of the disease. The availability of automated quantification tools will help evaluating treatment efficacy if new therapeutic approaches are developed. Lastly, the developed tools for early diagnosis, evaluation of severity and prediction of outcomes could prove useful if other viral pandemic occurs in the future.

Included are a broad range of occupations including those working in the community (police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, screening staff) as well as in permanent or temporary sites that care for patients (service staff, nurses, physicians and other health professionals). CHAMPS will obtain data on various exposure factors and health and create a registry of participants for extended follow up and sub-studies. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The objective of the US COVID-19 CHAMPS Study is to assess the short- and long-term physical, social and behavioral health of all who were involved in supporting or delivering care for COVID-19 patients. Included are first responders, maintenance and support staff as well as healthcare professionals of all specialties and services. Initially the study will obtain data on the working environment and emotional and physical health. Additional data will be obtained on self-management, response strategies, effects on family, social and personal life and careers. This well-characterized cohort of workers will enable characterization of the health and social effects of their service, and prospective research on their future physical and mental health. It will also serve as a registry for future, hypothesis-driven sub-studies of behavioral and biological coping mechanisms and allostatic load, as well as randomized clinical trials. Participants will be recruited throughout the United States and its territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands) with outcomes followed longitudinally for twenty years. Initial analysis will be descriptive and include computation of frequency distributions, adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Multiple logistic regression methods will be used to assess association of health symptoms or conditions with estimates of exposure to COVID-19. Psychological distress will be estimated from self-reported responses to validated psychological instruments and survey items created to capture the unique aspects of exposure to COVID-19 in workplace settings. Odds rations will be adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity and job classification. The logistic regression model(s) will include self-reported baseline health status and other variables. Preliminary explorations of variable associations will be performed to aid with the development of sub-studies from the registry. No direct health benefits are anticipated for participating in the study, but participants may learn about their health. Participation in the study provides the participants the opportunity to express the impact of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on their health, which may be a source of relief. Participants may feel satisfaction about sharing information about their experiences that may help healthcare systems to plan for future health-related emergencies.",N/A

Patient navigation is a barrier focused, long-term patient-centered intervention that offers support for a defined set of health services. The intervention under investigation is a comprehensive postpartum patient navigator program. Women who are randomized to receive patient navigation will be compared to women who are randomized to receive usual care. Navigators will support women through one year postpartum. The NNM2 program will be grounded in understanding and addressing social determinants of health in order to promote self-efficacy, enhance access, and sustain long-term engagement. Participants will undergo surveys, interviews, and medical record review at 4-12 weeks and 11-13 months postpartum. The investigators will additionally conduct focus groups and surveys with clinical providers. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The postpartum period - often called the ""fourth trimester"" - is a time of rapid and intense change in the life of a woman and her family, and uptake of health care during this transition is critical to optimizing women's long-term health and the health of their subsequent pregnancies. The importance of postpartum care has been reinforced by professional organizations, yet postpartum care in the United States remains inadequate. Substantial racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care uptake, quality, and outcomes exist. Improving health for all women requires the development of new, more comprehensive approaches to postpartum and interconceptional care. One potential model may be patient navigation, which is a barrier-focused, longitudinal, patient-centered intervention that offers support for a defined set of health services. This protocol is to evaluate whether implementation of a postpartum patient navigation program improves health outcomes among low-income women. The investigators previously developed a postpartum patient navigation program, called Navigating New Motherhood (NNM), which introduced a clinic-level intervention in which a patient navigator assumed postpartum supportive and logistical responsibilities for low-income women. Navigation was associated with improvements in outcomes (retention in care, contraception uptake, vaccination, and depression screening) compared to those of a historical cohort. The investigators now propose to test the efficacy of the updated NNM model - called ""NNM2"" - via a randomized trial. The study will randomize 400 pregnant or postpartum women (1:1) with publicly-funded prenatal care to NNM2 versus usual care. Women randomized to navigation will be provided intensive, individualized, one-on-one navigation services through 12 weeks postpartum and, based on individual needs, ongoing, tapered navigation through one year postpartum. The NNM2 program will be grounded in understanding and addressing social determinants of health in order to promote self-efficacy, enhance access, and sustain long-term engagement. Participants will undergo surveys, interviews, and medical record review at 4-12 weeks and 11-13 months postpartum. Aim 1 will evaluate whether the navigation program improves clinical outcomes at 4-12 weeks postpartum as measured via a composite of health status that includes retention in care, receipt of recommended counseling, receipt of desired contraception, postpartum depression screening/care, breastfeeding initiation/maintenance, and receipt of preventive care. Sub-Aims will include investigation of outcomes at 11-13 months postpartum. Aim 2 will evaluate whether NNM2 improves patient-reported outcomes. Aim 3 additionally involves examining obstetric and primary care provider perspectives on the navigation program and on optimizing the postpartum transition. Completion of this study will fill an evidence gap by demonstrating whether postpartum patient navigation is an effective mechanism to improve women's short- and long-term health, enhance health care utilization, and improve patient and provider satisfaction.

It is not possible to give an exact number of cases, because it is not possible to estimate exactly how many COVID-19 patients will be admitted to the listed intensive care units in Graz. Recruitment will start when approved from the ethical board and end in June, 2020. Inclusion criteria - Admission on an isolation unit - intensive care unit of the University Clinic of Graz - Detection of a SARS - CoV-2 infection by PCR (tracheal or pharyngeal secretion) or CT examination (with consecutive PCR confirmation) - male and female sex - subordinated declaration of consent if possible* - respiratory insufficiency with indication for non-invasive or invasive ventilation during admission to an intensive care unit Informed consent Since the study patients are intensive care patients, it may happen that the informed consent cannot be obtained at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (e.g.: patient is not able to give consent due to mechanical ventilation), in this case the informed consent will be obtained at a later time (e.g.: at the latest upon discharge from the intensive care unit/hospital. (* In exceptional cases it may happen that patients cannot sign a declaration of consent at admission as well as at discharge from the intensive care unit (e.g.: during the stay continuous mechanical ventilation and death at the intensive care unit). Study related measures In addition to the standardized routine laboratory (daily, in the morning approx. 05.00 o'clock), a lipid profile (LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, Lpa, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol) is taken once upon admission to the intensive care unit in order to determine the cardiovascular risk upon admission to the intensive care unit. This lipid profile is taken with the aid of a vacuette (9 ml corresponds to approx. 2 teaspoons of whole blood). Study related patient questionnaire for the determination of cardiovascular risk The patient questionnaire should be filled out by interviewing the patients at the time of admission to the intensive care unit. If the condition of the patients does not allow this, the information in the questionnaire should be carried out by a member of the study staff by researching the patient's medical history (e.g. doctor's letters, electronic data acquisition, etc.). The questionnaire is used to assess the cardiovascular risk (contains medication, past medical history). Non-study-related measures (standardised routine analyses in an intensive care unit) To determine the cardiovascular risk: See Patient Questionnaire, Lipid Status, HbA1c For follow-up (daily routine laboratory checks): Blood count, coagulation, liver and kidney counts, triglycerides, biomarkers (CK, CK-MB, TropT, NTproBNP, CRP, PCT, IL-6, D-dimer, LDH, myoglobin). Other parameters and therapies that are considered in the evaluation or that are used to create the data set: Fluid introduction, fluid discharge, balance, prone positioning, non-invasive ventilation (PEEP, fiO2), invasive ventilation (ventilation mode, PEEP, Pinsp, fiO2, AF), respiration (respiratory rate, fiO2, SpO2, paO2, pCO2, etCO2), circulation parameters (RR syst, RR dia, MAP, HF, ECG (rhythm, Qtc)), extracorporeal organ support procedures, mortality, med. complications, entire drug therapy (e.g: norepinephrine (incl. dose), levosimendan (incl. dose), vasopressin (incl. dose), cortisone (incl. dose), dobutamine (incl. dose), supportive therapy (zinc, vitamin C, selenium), antifungal and antibiotic therapy, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab. Anonymisation of patients After enrolment in the study, the patient data is encoded/pseudo-anonymised, i.e. patients are identified with a consecutive ID number (neither name, initials nor laboratory requirement number are recorded). To find out the previous illnesses of intensive care patients it is necessary to create a list of patient names and the corresponding ID numbers for pseudonymisation. This list remains with the investigator. Use of clinical data For the statistical analysis, clinical data in pseudo-anonymised/encoded form are used, e.g. diagnosis, concomitant diseases, long-term medication, intensive care therapy, medication, smoking, age, sex.

Besides these known factors, the underlying mechanisms that lead to increased inflammation that appears to be the mechanism of acute severe lung disease and multi-organ failure, remain largely unknown. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is increased in patients, and several clinical trials have now been registered which plan to investigate the effect of the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody tocilizumab, as an inhibitor of inflammation in COVID-19.  ***   According to the observations of the Chinese patients in Wuhan and other epicentres of the pandemic, and confirmed by our own observations, progression towards severe lung injury and multi-organ failure occurs around one week after onset of symptoms. Beside the known risk factors that somewhat help clinicians predict which patients are vulnerable, in this study, pro-inflammatory biomarker profiles, including IL-6, will be used to stratify these patients in a more substantiated manner. The specific biomarker profiles which are associated with the development of acute severe lung disease, can be targeted in new and patient specific treatments for COVID-19, to prevent further deterioration. ***    ***   Objectives:  ***   - Identifying the pro-inflammatory biomarker profile in the pathophysiology of acute sever lung disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and using this profile to identify the patients who are at risk of developing acute severe lung disease and multi-organ failure. ***   - Identifying cellular immune biomarkers that predict higher chance to develop acute severe lung disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection, both at admission and during monitoring. ***    ***   Study design:  ***   Prospective Observational Cohort Study ***    ***   Study population:  ***   Patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, who are 18 years or older ***    ***   Main study parameters/endpoints:  ***   The main endpoint is the identification of pro-inflammatory biomarkers and cellular immune biomarkers in the development of acute severe lung injury and multi-organ failure in infection with SARS-CoV-2  ***    ***   Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:  ***   The burden of this study for the participants is related to extra blood samples and nasal swabs.

Specifically, the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the program will be assessed, collecting data from all implementation stakeholders at baseline, 13 weeks, 25 weeks, and post-intervention (~50 weeks) using quantitative survey instruments and qualitative interviews. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The intervention is an adaptation of the evidence-based REACH program (Resources Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health), designed for and validated in multiple settings to give education, tools, and support to informal caregivers of people with dementia, delivered through a series of at-home visits (minimum of 9 in-person and 3 phone sessions) conducted by trained and certified coaches over 6-12 months. The content of the coaching visits will follow the REACH program protocol, with materials customized with information about local community resources (e.g., Dane County). Coach/administrator training for delivery of the REACH intervention will be conducted by master trainers from the Rosalynn Carter Institute (RCI) for Caregiving, a department of Georgia Southwestern State University, who administers, certifies, and provides oversight for REACH sites nationally (https://www.rosalynncarter.org/programs/rci-reach/). For the purposes of this pilot study, the investigators have coordinated with RCI to extend delivery of REACH content over a 12-month period, with home visits occurring more frequently at the beginning and spreading further apart towards the end, and additional phone ""REVIEW"" sessions between home-visits. Each home visit covers specific coaching content, building on strategies and behaviors covered in prior sessions. The program includes flexibility to allow coaches to adapt the timing/delivery of content to attend to the needs of the caregiver (e.g., answering questions about previously-covered topics, covering topics from a future visit to help coach a caregiver through an emergent dementia-related issue). Sessions typically last 1-2 hours. Following each visit, the coach completes a fidelity checklist and writes client progress notes as per the REACH protocol. This pilot adapts prior REACH implementations in two main ways: (1) intervention coaches will be community paramedics with advanced medical training, rather than social workers (or other non-medical social service personnel), and (2) the program will be formally coordinated with the participant and caregiver's primary care practice, allowing for care coordination and information sharing between participants, coaches, and clinic staff/providers. Participants will also have the ability to share information about their use of community dementia care resources (e.g., social services, transportation, senior center case management, dementia caregiver support groups, dementia-related educational programming, respite) with coaches so they can communicate necessary information to the clinic for possible inclusion in the participant's Electronic Health Record (EHR) (as per the clinic's determination), facilitate care coordination, and help keep the participant's care plan up to date. Paramedic coaches will be utilizing their medical knowledge, but not providing any direct medical care. This pilot study also differs from prior REACH trials in that outcome measures include health care and emergency services utilization, particularly related to the occurrence of acute medical and behavioral problems, as well as perceptions of health care quality, in addition to caregiver psycho-socio-emotional measures (already included in the standard REACH assessment package). The study will employ a stepped design using a rapid-cycle evaluation approach. Three cohorts of 4-5 patient-caregiver dyads each will start the intervention at staggered intervals. Within each cohort, a new dyad will begin the program approximately every two weeks, with an approximate four week gap between each cohort for feedback collection and program iteration. Real-time feedback obtained from multiple intervention stakeholders (caregivers, persons with dementia, coaches, clinical staff/providers - up to 10 enrolled) will be used to iteratively improve intervention delivery and program implementation for the next, all while the first group continues the pilot. In this way, problems can be identified and solutions generated, with enough time to adapt the program and evaluate revisions. Staggering participant start dates allows for multiple rapid-cycle iterations within a single pilot study.

It also contributes to the inhibition of ROS production and to the remodulation of the cytokine network typical of systemic inflammatory syndrome. Recent studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of vitamin C administration in terms of reducing mortality, in patients with sepsis hospitalized in intensive care wards. Given this background, in the light of the current COVID-19 emergency, since the investigators cannot carry out a randomized controlled trial, it is their intention to conduct a study in the cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia, administering 10 gr of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The Sars-COV-2, has spread all over the world, in two months after its discovery in China. Outbreaks have been reported in more than 50 countries with more than 118,223 confirmed cases and 4,291 deaths worldwide. In Italy, the scenario is progressively worsening with 8514 confirmed cases and 631 deaths at 10/3/2020. Along with the spread of this new virus there has been an increase in the number of pneumonia identified with the term novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which are characterized by fever, asthenia, dry cough, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated lactic dehydrogenase, and a tomographic imaging indicative of interstitial pneumonia (ground glass and patchy shadows). Recent studies have shown the efficacy of vitamin C and thiamine administration in patients hospitalized for sepsis in the setting of intensive wards in terms of mortality reduction. The use of intravenously vitamin C arises from the experimental evidence of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Vitamin C causes a greater proliferation of natural killers without affecting their functionality. Moreover, the vitamin C reduces the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that contribute to the activation of the inflammosomi and, in particular, the NLRP3 that affetcs the maturation and secretion of cytokines such as IL1beta and IL-18 that are involved in the inflammatory systemic syndrome that characterized sepsis. Vitamin C blocks the expression of ICAM-1 and activation of NFKappaB that are involved in inflammatory, neoplastic, and apoptotic processes by the inhibition of TNFalfa. For this reason, the use of vitamin C could be effective in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes in the cohort of patients with covid-19 pneumonia. In view of the emergency of SARS-VOC-2 and the impossibility of carrying out a randomized controlled study, it is their intention to conduct an intervention protocol (administration of 10 grams of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy) involving the cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia.

The COVID19 is much more dangerous for people over 60 with a death rate of 3.6% after 60, 8.0% after 70 and 14.8% after 80 -and according to our Italian colleagues over 20% after 90- against 2.3% in the general population. The elderly patients exhibits more complications (ARDS, delirium, cardiac and renal insufficiency) needing intensive care, and often had multiple comorbidities and in particular: cardiovascular disease (10.5% mortality), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6%). Very few data are available the specific burden of Infectious diseases (ID) in older populations. The large majority of literature is often related to intrahospital or direct mortality and only recently arise the idea of indirect impact of ID particularly in that populations. In that meaning, ID may be considered as a trigger of other medical events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or other specific outcomes such as functional decline; For the last 10 years, the Specific interest group "" GInGer ""( Groupe Infectio-Geriatrique ) a network of infectiologist and geriatrician SPILF/SFGG) carried out several studies on different aspects of ID in theses populations and recently demonstrated the indirect and long term impact of influenza and Clostridioides difficile infections. As an example, In influenza study, death-rate increases from 12,2 % in hospital related death to 25% at 3 months with high rate of complications (57%), high rates of rehospitalisation (25%) and functional decline (35%) leading to high increase in nursing home admission. The cost of these indirect impact is high and underestimated. Because of incidence and comorbidities rates, severity of the actual French older COVID 19-infected older populations and because of the potential indirect and long term impact of COVID19 in these populations, it seems essential to know whether 3 month related death is largely higher as for influenza, to determine risk factors for intra hospital and long term death, measure acute and long term complications, and describe the impact of COVID 19 on specific ageing outcomes such as functional status at Month 3 (M3).",N/A

In one group the disease progresses slowly and patients have a low potential of developing mild respiratory failure, but in the other group, an exaggerated immune response (hyper-inflammation/cytokine storm) may be linked to the onset of precipitous respiratory failure, termed acute respiratory distress syndrome. This syndrome is responsible for a large portion of COVID-19 associated mortality. Thus, determining links between hyper-inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients is of immediate importance. Blood samples will undergo a number of analyses to help us to understand as much as possible about COVID-19. We will also study any differences in physiologic and cytokine levels before and after patients are treated with immunomodulatory therapies as part of clinical care in COVID-19 patients. ***  *** Detailed Description *** PURPOSES 1. Determine the prevalence of a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory ""cytokine storm"" phenotype in patients at Vancouver General Hospital 2. Determine any potential links between cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients 3. Profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own 4. Elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19 5. Identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs 6. To determine differences in physiologic and cytokine levels before and after patients are treated with immunomodulatory therapies as part of clinical care in COVID-19 patients. HYPOTHESES 1. Primary: Based off of previous reports, approximately 50% of COVID-19 patients will demonstrate a cytokine storm phenotype 2. Secondary: a)Patients exhibiting cytokine storm will demonstrate a higher incidence of ARDS b)We will identify biomarkers for rapid testing c)Host gene variation will influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection JUSTIFICATION The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19. Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS, which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains debated currently. CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of 31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells. McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections. There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own. Genetic Testing: Authors have shown that host genetic differences have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from sepsis. The hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19. RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class. These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease. Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA, clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as little as 50µl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for both serum and plasma OBJECTIVES Better understand 1)the links between cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients 2)the biomarker profile of COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease 3)the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients RESEARCH DESIGN Overview Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the management of COVID-19. Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and 21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum separator tubes (SST, Vacutainer®, Becton & Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital. A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for cytokine storm syndrome. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult. However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α data is provided. The below presented power calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1): IL-1: This was not significantly different in the report by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020). IL-2: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 9.5±4.3 and 6.7±4.3 pg/mL of IL-2 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,~40 patients per group (80 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05) IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020). IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05). TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05) Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients. A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value >20. We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison analysis. Analysis Plan Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed. A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum biomarkers. Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Nested matched cohort study: 1. Examine the differences in the ventilator free days in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using an independent samples two-tailed t-test. 2. Examine the differences in the cardiorespiratory physiologic outcomes (PaO2/FiO2, mean arterial pressure and heart rate) in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using independent samples two-tailed t-tests. 3.

This study is sponsored and led by members of the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group (PNCRG). ***  *** Detailed Description *** Early reports of COVID-19 indicate that adults experience a variety of neurological symptoms and diagnoses in approximately 36% of patients, including headaches, seizures, coma, encephalitis, and cerebrovascular events including ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thromboses. In children, recent evidence highlights acute and long-term neurological manifestations due to other viral illnesses including Guillain Barre syndrome and neonatal microcephaly with Zika virus, encephalitis with H1N1 influenza, and acute flaccid paralysis with enterovirus-68. However, COVID-19 reports in children published thus far lack detailed information on the frequency and outcomes of neurological findings. COVID-19 cases are rapidly rising internationally, with experts forecasting subsequent global surges and continued activity. Thus, it is imperative to accurately document prevalence and outcomes of the neurological aspects of COVID-19 specifically in children. Such data will serve to alert clinicians and families about the possibility that children may present with neurologic rather than ""classic"" symptoms of COVID-19 who nevertheless would warrant testing, and that neurologic events can occur subsequent to the diagnosis that may impact long-term outcomes (e.g., cognitive, emotional, physical health). The investigators anticipate that improved knowledge about neurologic manifestations in children will bolster personalized treatment and rehabilitation strategies to optimize child outcomes and inform future interventional studies.",N/A

Clinical manifestations vary widely from one individual to another, from asymptomatic carrier to a febrile cough that can rapidly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, screening by chest X-ray (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 conducted by the Cornwall Hospital Union laboratory has shown that among symptomatic patients and hospital staff suspected of being COVID-19, only 7.8% were attributable to COVID-19. Two nosocomial clusters were also identified, in the emergency department (10 carers) and in the cardiology department (6 carers and one patient). However, direct diagnosis by RT-PCR has sensitivity limits and can lead to false negative results when the subject is indeed suffering from COVID-19. This lack of sensitivity is inherent to the technique on the one hand, but also to the quality of the sample and the kinetics of the infection. Indeed, the virological window during which the virus is present in the respiratory mucous membranes sampled seems relatively narrow, hence a progressive negativation of the respiratory samples as the disease progresses. Moreover, clinical symptoms vary from one individual to another, and it is now recognized that some infected persons are asymptomatic but carry the virus. Thus, the use of a second diagnostic technique is a necessity, and serology could be a relevant diagnostic support. In the literature, several publications report the performance of COVID-19 serology in clusters of cases or cohorts of subjects. The serological techniques employed are variable (target epitopes in particular) and frequently homemade. Serology is mainly studied in comparison or association with RT-PCR in order to highlight the increased performance of COVID-19 diagnosis when the two techniques are combined. Correlation with chest CT imaging data is also encountered. Numerous serological tests are therefore being tested to determine retrospectively whether the individual has been exposed to the virus by looking for specific antibodies to the virus. The supreme health authority has drawn up specifications dated 16 April 2020, defining the methods for evaluating the performance of serological tests detecting antibodies directed against SARSCoV-2 in order to provide a framework for these practices. Several clinical studies are also underway, in particular to assess the kinetics of the appearance of the antibodies, whether these specific antibodies would be protective and whether their appearance would coincide with a cessation of contagiousness. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the COVID-19 immunoglobulin (IgG) Dia-Pro serological test, in view of its deployment at the Cornish Hospital Union Laboratory. Subsequently, given the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Brittany and the risk of a second epidemic wave when the confinement is lifted, the evaluation of the seroprevalence of the staff of the Cornish Hospital Union is necessary in order to assess the attack rate of COVID-19 within the establishment and particularly within departments where nosocomial clusters have been reported; and to prevent the impact of deconfinement. Indeed, knowledge of the proportion of immunized personnel and its distribution according to services will make it possible to establish internal recommendations and to effectively manage personal protective equipment inventories, in conjunction with the deconfinement strategy that will be implemented by the government. The goal is to protect hospital staff from overexposure to the virus;",N/A

It has spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems by causing high rates of critical illness. Mortality from COVID-19 exceeds 4%, with older people with comorbidities being extremely vulnerable.It is expected that between 50-80% of the world's population may contract SARS-CoV-2 over the next two years. It is expected the outcomes to be potentially worse in Africa, because firstly, there is a limited workforce, and secondly there are limited intensive care facilities and critical care resources across Africa to provide sufficient care. It is estimated that there are 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 1.45) critical care beds per 100,000 population in Africa. It is likely that the volume of unplanned admissions associated with COVID-19 will further adversely affect critical care outcomes in Africa,especially as the ability of healthcare systems in Africa to adapt and expand during the pandemic to meet the clinical workload is unknown. Furthermore, the patient outcomes in critical care is poorly documented in this under-resourced environment. Most countries in Africa are still in the early phase of the epidemic which provides the opportunity to study the utilization of critical care resources and their impact on patient outcomes. It is important therefore to establish what resources, comorbidities and interventions are potentially associated with either mortality or survival in Africa. Rapid dissemination of these findings may help inform appropriate resource prioritisation and utilisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. These points provide the rationale for the African Covid-19 Critical Care Outcomes Study (ACCCOS).

The current pandemic of this emerging virus is an opportunity to assess the proportion of acute myocarditis attributable to SARS-Cov-2(Covid-19) and to assess the clinical, biological and imaging presentations, by means of a national prospective multicentre hospital registry of cases of acute myocarditis. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Although research on the subject has only recently started developing, the links have already been described between SARS-Cov-2 infection, the severity of the clinical status, and the presence of risk factors or a history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, etc.). Additionally, depending on the series and definition used for cardiac injury (troponin elevation and/or natriuretic peptides), this concerns 7-29% of patients with a clear predominance in severe patients. The mechanisms behind these troponin elevations and cardiac injury are likely to be multiple and variable depending on clinical presentation,severity and patient history. A significant association was found between troponin elevation, and that of CRP and NtproBNP, suggesting an inflammatory part to this cardiac damage. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause massive release of proinflammatory cytokines which can lead to inflammation of the vascular wall. This can be the cause of true instability or even rupture of plaque(type1 infarction) but can also be responsible for tissue hypoxia without rupture of plaque causing myocardial pain (infarction type 2). In addition, there may be areal myocardial inflammation causing acute myocarditis, secondary to the cytokine storm or direct damage to the myocardium by the virus itself. In case of acute coronary syndrome presentation, a coronary exploration should be realized to highlight or eliminate a type 1 infarction, but it is clearly difficult to distinguish between a type 2 suffering (no viral attack direct but suffering from hypotension or hypoxia for example) and inflammatory myocardial damage with or without direct viral myocardial damage (myocarditis). In the context of the viral pandemic at Covid19, although few data exist,it is legitimate to consider the possibility of true arrays of acute inflammatory myocarditis or by direct viral attack which could thus modify the natural history and the prognosis of patients, thus justifying a dedicated diagnosis and treatment. The primary objective was to assess the proportion of positive SARS-Cov-2 cases among the patients included (hospitalized for acute myocarditis). During the study period, this proportion will be assessed at regular intervals, for example every month, or more frequently if the number of patients included varies substantially from one week to another. This will make it possible to trace a development curve for the entire period of the pandemic. The secondary objectives were (1) to describe the clinical, biological and imaging characteristics of the acute myocarditis among the positive and negative SARS-Cov-2 patients of the myocarditis cohort; (2) to assess the short-term (30 days) and long-term (1 year) prognosis of the acute myocarditis among the positive and negative SARS-Cov-2 patients of the myocarditis cohort and (3) to identify the factors associated with a 30-day and 1-year prognosis of cases of acute myocarditis.",N/A

In this study, the investigators aim to observe patients with COVID-19 via SmartWatches on top of their clinical routine. The investigators aim to determine, whether the addition of SmartWatches enhances risk stratification, early detection of complications and prognostics in patients with COVID-19, who have cardiovascular diseases or receive medication with arrhythmogenic risk. The study is a monocentric observational study in the sense of a cohort study. 50 COVID-19 patients are aimed to be included. Patients are identified upon presentation at the COVID-19 outpatient clinic or during their stay at the COVID-19 ward at the Centre for Internal Medicine (Krehl-Klinik) at the Heidelberg University Hospital. Since many study-relevant data are routinely collected at presentation in the outpatient clinic or during the inpatient stay, these values are being accessed (e.g. anamnesis, physical examination, ECGs, CT and laboratory values) by our study team. The recruited subjects (n=50) receive medical care according to the instructions of the treating physicians. The treating physicians decide whether a home or inpatient quarantine is necessary and whether a specific therapy is required. SmartWatches are provided to all subjects on the day of recruitment. These are Apple Watches (Series 5). The patient is asked to record an ECG on the Apple Watch 5 times a day (8:00 am, 11:00 am, 2:00 pm, 5:00 pm, 8:00 pm). Furthermore, the activity of the patient is recorded via the App Health. The data collected by the Apple Watch (activity and health-related data of the App Health as well as ECGs) are accessible to the study team at any time, provided that the pseudonymised data transfer via Email has been successfully completed. In order to be able to use the Apple Watch, participants are provided with an iPhone by us. As soon as the COVID-19 disease is cured or the participant died, the study ends for them. However, the study will be conducted for at least 14 days for each patient, even if the patient has healed earlier. If findings relevant to the health of the patients should arise from the study-relevant data (for example the detection of cardiac arrhythmias via the Apple Watch), the investigators report these information to the treating physician and patient as soon as possible.",N/A

The main of objective of this study is to investigate whether loss/or reduced sense of smell and/or taste in the absence of fever and/or persistent cough are indicative of Coronavirus Infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In addition, the study aims to investigate whether loss/or reduced sense of smell and/or taste precede the development of fever and persistent cough in people with COVID-19 infection and also whether loss of/reduced sense of smell and/or taste changes can be used to predict the clinical course of the disease. General public FORECAST: Participants over the age of 18 will be sent a text message invite through participating GP practices' patient messaging systems. This will direct participants to a website (hosted by Dendrite Clinical Systems) where study subjects will find the participant information sheet, screening checks and consent form. Enrolled participants will complete an online questionnaire containing questions about smell and taste changes, as well as other symptoms of COVID-19. Participants will then be sent a near-patient rapid antibody test kit for COVID-19 to be undertaken only under medical supervision. Participants will be booked for a video conference appointment with either a doctor or nurse and the screening test will be performed under medical supervision. The outcome of the test will be documented, discussed with the patient and appropriate advice given. Four weeks after completing the first questionnaire participant will be sent an email and / or text message asking them to complete a second questionnaire. This second questionnaire will contain questions about resolution of smell/taste symptoms and other symptoms of COVID-19. In case COVID-19 positive patients are subsequently admitted to hospital as a result of COVID-19, consent will be obtained to collect information on the outcome of the admission from discharge letter via GP.

Study temporarily on Administrative Hold to comply with current COVID-19 restrictions. Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and co-morbid conditions are prevalent in returning Veterans with the reported rates ranging from 14- 22%. Chronic sequela of mTBI can be highly debilitating due to deficits in the cognitive control processes, including attention, executive functions, and memory. In prior studies, individuals with chronic acquired brain injury who participated in a cognitive training program, Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS), which targets executive control functions of applied mindfulness-based attention regulation and goal management, improved cognitive performance in areas of: complex attention/executive function and memory, complex functional task performance, and daily functioning. Furthermore, functional MRI (fMRI) results after training indicated significantly enhanced modulation of neural processing. Preliminary data from recently completed randomized-control GOALS study in 32 Veterans with chronic TBI also show both short and longer term (up to 2 years) improvements in attention and executive function, complex real-life tasks, and emotional regulation. The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the potential short and longer term effects of GOALS cognitive training program, and to use advanced MRI to investigate changes in brain structure and function in the circuits that regulate attention, memory, executive function and emotion in Veterans with chronic mTBI. The investigators postulate that 1) GOALS training will improve neurocognitive function in attention and executive function domains, complex functional task performance, and emotional regulation in Veterans with chronic mTBI; 2) improved neurocognitive function will be correlated with macrostructural, microstructural and functional changes in the corresponding brain networks on high field (3T) and ultra-high field (7T) structural MR imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state fMRI performed pre- and post-training; 3) Changes in both behavioral function and imaging measures will be maintained at 6 months post-training and be associated with improvements in activities and participation. AIM 1: To determine the short and long term effects of GOALS training on neuro-cognitive performance and neural plasticity of attention and executive control networks in mTBI. AIM 2: To determine the short and long term effects of GOALS training on complex functional task performance and daily functioning, and on plasticity in pathways related to memory function, in mTBI. AIM 3: To determine the short and long term effects of GOALS training on measures of emotional regulation, and on plasticity of frontolimbic networks related to emotion processing, in mTBI In a randomized, controlled interventional study design, 36 Veterans with a history of chronic (> 6 month) mTBI and residual cognitive difficulties will be randomized to participate in 5 weeks of cognitive training (GOALS) or a treatment as usual (TAU) comparison. At baseline, week 5 (post GOALS), and at 6 months, participants will undergo a multi-level assessment battery consisting of: 1) neuroimaging with high field (3T) and ultra-high field (7T) structural MR imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state fMRI; 2) neuropsychological assessment focusing on complex attention and executive function; 3) complex 'real life' functional task performance; and 4) self-report measures of daily functioning and emotional regulation/health. Additionally, the investigators will be recruiting a separate cohort of 15 equally matched healthy veteran volunteers who have no TBI history, for normative comparisons. TBI-negative participants, who will not be participating in training sessions, will have neuroimaging with ultra-high field (7T) structural MR imaging and neuropsychological assessments at baseline and week 5.

Equine-facilitated therapy (EFT), an animal-assisted form of CIH, is increasingly available to Veterans within the VA. Horses have extreme sensitivity to the emotional states, behaviors, and intentions of their herds and other animals, including humans, and mirror body language and respond to subtle nonverbal cues. As such, horses have the capacity to provide immediate feedback about a people's emotional and behavioral states. This capacity affords people opportunities to become more emotionally self-aware and, with guidance from EFT facilitators, learn how to regulate emotions and become calmer and more patient, attentive, and confident to gain the horses' cooperation. Participants in EFT are encouraged to apply what they have learned from their equine experiences to their relationships with people.

VAs are increasingly embracing EFT as a CIH. However, carefully conducted, scientifically valid research about EFT has not been conducted. Existing peer-reviewed research about EFT for mental health is very limited, of poor methodological quality, and not focused on adults. None of it targets social functioning as a main outcome. This small randomized controlled pilot study proposes to examine an innovative EFT called The Equus Effect (TEE) as a complement to Veterans' existing VA mental health services to improve social functioning. TEE aims to improve Veterans' social functioning by developing their emotion regulation and interpersonal skills through therapeutic interactions with horses. This study will evaluate 1) the feasibility of study procedures, assessments, and outcomes, 2) the fidelity of experimental and control interventions, and 3) the acceptability of the interventions to Veterans and their mental health clinicians using mixed quantitative-qualitative methods. The study has the potential to lend initial credibility to the therapeutic claims of this increasingly popular CIH. ***  *** Detailed Description *** **Please note that as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and after consultation with the appropriate research oversight, regulatory and monitoring entities, screening and enrollment has been placed on temporary administrative hold as of 04/30/2020.** The VA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation launched the Whole Health initiative to transform the Veterans Health Administration into a healthcare system in which providers and Veterans develop holistic, personalized, proactive, patient-driven healthcare plans that center on realizing meaningful life goals and improved functioning. Whole Health promotes the use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches with traditional medical care to achieve these aims - consistent with psychosocial rehabilitation's emphasis on recovery-oriented, community-based functional outcomes. Equine-facilitated therapy (EFT), an animal-assisted form of CIH, is increasingly available to Veterans within the VA. Horses are prey animals with extreme sensitivity to the emotional states, behaviors, and intentions of their herds and other animals, including humans, and mirror body language and respond to subtle nonverbal cues. As such, horses have the capacity to provide immediate feedback about a person's emotional and behavioral states (e.g., pinning ears back when someone is angry or relaxing them forward when a person is calm). As a person interacts with horses, this capacity affords him or her an opportunity to become more emotionally self-aware and, with guidance from EFT facilitators, learn how to regulate emotions and become calmer and more patient, attentive, and confident to gain the horses' cooperation. With EFT, emotion regulation is the key mechanism for social interaction with horses, and participants in EFT are encouraged to apply what they have learned from their equine experiences to their relationships with people. Since high quality social functioning depends on effective regulation of one's emotions, EFT offers a novel way in which to improve the social functioning of Veterans with mental health concerns. In fact, in the VA, EFT has been used to address a variety of diagnostic issues commonly experience by Veterans, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, substance use and eating disorders. However, peer-reviewed published quantitative and qualitative research on EFT as a CIH for mental health is very limited, of poor methodological quality, and focused on school-age children and adolescents, not adults. None of it targets social functioning as a main outcome. Given VAs increasing embrace of EFT as a CIH, carefully conducted research that aims to systematically develop and study EFT for Veterans is sorely needed to ensure that EFT is feasible to study, acceptable to Veterans and clinicians, and clinically promising. The investigators propose to pilot test an innovative EFT called The Equus Effect (TEE) as a complement to Veterans' existing VA mental health services to improve social functioning. TEE aims to improve Veterans' social functioning by developing their emotion regulation and interpersonal skills through therapeutic interactions with horses. In line with recommendations for pilot investigations, the investigators will conduct a randomized pilot study to 1) evaluate the feasibility of study procedures, assessments, and outcomes, 2) demonstrate experimental and control interventions can be delivered with fidelity, and 3) examine the acceptability of the interventions. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will enroll a transdiagnostic cohort of 40 Veterans involved in VA mental health services with social dysfunction and emotion dysregulation. Participants will be randomized to receive either 1) TEE or 2) attention control (AC), both group interventions. Each week, the 4-session TEE will include 1) mindfulness activities, 2) emotion regulation and interpersonal skills education, 3) experiential activities with horses incorporating opportunities to develop emotion regulation and interpersonal skills, and 4) between-session application of lessons learned from the equine activities. AC will have similar elements without equine features. Intervention outcomes will be measured at 4- and 16-weeks post randomization. Specifically, using mixed quantitative-qualitative methods, the investigators aim to: Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, and implementation of TEE and AC. Hypothesis: Rates of recruitment will be at least 8 participants per month, and Veterans randomized to TEE will attend intervention sessions, remain in the study, and experience clinically significant changes in social functioning and emotion dysregulation at rates equal to or superior to AC. Aim 2: Demonstrate TEE and AC can be delivered with fidelity. Hypothesis: Facilitators will deliver each intervention consistently and as intended across sessions. Aim 3: Establish acceptability of TEE and AC by assessing intervention credibility and satisfaction and the usefulness of TEE as a complementary mental health intervention using mixed quantitative-qualitative methods. Hypothesis: Veterans will find TEE and AC credible and satisfying and Veterans and their mental health clinicians will qualitatively report the therapeutic benefits of TEE as a CIH for mental health treatment.",N/A

Without aortic valve replacement, the survival prognosis of patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis is poor. In the PARTNER 1B trial, all-cause mortality among 179 inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis allocated to conservative management amounted to 51% at one year [2]. Consistently, prospective registry data reported a mortality rate of 55% at 1 year in 78 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing conservative management [3]. The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems. A limited number of ventilators and ICU beds call for a careful allocation of healthcare resources. On March 20 2020, the Federal Council prohibited elective interventions in all hospitals in Switzerland. Patients with untreated severe aortic stenosis are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] and face the dual risk of cardiac death from aortic stenosis on one side, and death from acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other. While the balance between the two risks is a matter of clinical judgement, the investigators established an algorithm for the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Patients with aortic stenosis deemed critical will undergo valvular replacement in spite of the ongoing pandemic while patients with severe but not critical aortic stenosis will undergo deferred intervention once the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections flattens. In the current situation, aortic valve replacement in patients with severe, non-critical aortic stenosis will be deferred in order to give priority to SARS-CoV-2 patients. This unique situation allows the investigators to study the effect of deferral of aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The study is an amendment to the Swiss-TAVI registry. In contrast to the Swiss-TAVI registry, patients are not enrolled at the time of aortic valve replacement, but already at the time of referral for aortic valve replacement. Primary Objective: The aim of the present observational study is to explore the effect of deferral of valvular replacement in patients with severe but not critical aortic stenosis on morbidity and mortality. The primary objective is to describe rates of morbidity and mortality among patients with severe but not critical aortic stenosis in the interval from referral/indication for valvular replacement to intervention. Project Design: The study is a prospective cohort study of patients with severe aortic stenosis referred for aortic valve replacement. All referrals for aortic valve replacement will be allocated to either ""transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)/ surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) (standard of care)"" or ""deferred intervention"" based on prespecified criteria. Patients with critical aortic stenosis as defined by an aortic valve area (AVA) <0.6 cm2 or a transvalvular mean gradient of >60 mmHg or a history of cardiac decompensation during the previous 3 months or clinical symptoms on minimal exertion (NYHA III) will be allocated to TAVR or SAVR.

Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors for death in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, serves as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates host cell entry in the lungs. In experimental models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in several organs, potentially promoting viral cell invasion, although these findings are not consistent across studies. Alternatively, ACEIs and ARBs may actually improve mechanisms of host defense or hyperinflammation, ultimately reducing organ injury. Finally, ACEIs and ARBs may have direct renal, pulmonary and cardiac protective benefits in the setting of COVID-19. Therefore, it is unclear if ACEIs and ARBs may be beneficial or harmful in patients with COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease in the world, the high prevalence of ACEIs or ARBs in these conditions, and the clinical equipoise regarding the continuation vs. discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID, a randomized trial is urgently needed.

No formal sample size calculation was made for this project but, on the basis of data available to date, considering the prevalence of hematological patients in Italy (0.4%) and assuming that these patients have the same risk of contracting COVID-19 as the general population, we supposed to enroll at least 250 patients (at March 24, 2020). Statistical analyses All data collected will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics: absolute and relative frequencies for discrete variables; mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range for continuous ones.

Melatonin, an endogenous hormone involved in circadian rhythm control, is an inexpensive and safe product that has shown protective effects in bacterial and viral infections likely due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. SARS-CoV 2 seems to relatively spare younger children and those who are infected develop the severe forms of the disease very rarely. Peak melatonin serum levels are higher in younger children and decrease with age. These levels are also higher in women, specially during pregnancy, who also seem to be less affected by the virus when compared to men. The investigators hypothesize that elevating peak melatonin levels to a range similar to that of children by administering 2 mg of melatonin daily might prevent the infection with SARS-CoV 2 among exposed healthcare workers.

Data from severly affected countries impressively demonstrate that COVID-19 fatality rates rapidly increase in times of overloaded health care services. Cardiovascular comorbidity seems to be associated with impaired outcome, e.g. with admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. However, a direct causal relation is questionable and pathophysiological mechanisms of the cardiovascular involvement such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are poorly understood. The clinical value of established and emerging biomarkers is largely unknown. Accordingly, early and reliable personalized risk prediction represents a major unmet clinical need, as it may allow evidence-based clinical decision aid for most effective resource allocation in the common fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims: To fill these gaps in knowledge, investigators designed the ""COronaVIrus surviVAl (COVIVA)"" study. With this study, investigators aim to deliver an open-source platform to i) perform extensive clinical and biomarker phenotyping in COVID-19 suspects presenting to the emergency department (ED) and in COVID-19 patients with subsequent ICU admission, ii) compare clinical and biomarker profiles of COVID-19 patients with a control group, iii) derive and validate personalized risk prediction models for early clinical decision support, and iv) explore pathophysiological mechanisms including inflammatory and cardiovascular pathways. Methodology: The COVIVA study is an ongoing, prospective, interdisciplinary, observational, case-control study with active enrolment of consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 triaged to the Emergency Department (ED) of the University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. Patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 will serve as cases while the remainders will serve as controls. Detailed clinical patient`s phenotyping (e.g. comorbidities, medications, symptoms, vitals, ECG and imaging data), extended laboratory analyses and blood sampling for bio banking are performed once in all patients (cases and control) at time of ED presentation and serially thereafter in the subset of COVID-19 patients with subsequent need for ICU admission. Primary outcome measure is in-hospital mortality; secondary outcome measures include the need for ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, 30-day post-discharge mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, resource use and quality of life 30 days after discharge and its composites. Personalized risk prediction models will be derived and validated based on advanced statistical models including machine-based learning incorporating a variety of clinical parameters and biomarker signatures (including digitally stored in-hospital data, e.g. imaging, ECG, ventilation parameters). Close cooperation with multiple other national and international COVID-19 cohorts is endorsed.

To investigate the still largely unknown pathophysiology of this disease, we have built a consortium of Italian Hospitals to include a large cohort of COVID-19 patients from mild out-patients managed by GPs to inpatients developing mild, moderate or severe disease assessed both in hospital and at a 3-6 month follow-up visit). Consortium partners have a wide expertise to allow for 1) comprehensive assessment of risk factors for severe COVID-19 syndrome; 2) study the pathophysiology of its cardio-respiratory manifestations; 3) estimate risk scores also with artificial intelligence and 4) assess its clinical immunoinflammatory and cardiorespiratory sequelae in discharged patients at short term follow-up. To this aim, we will 1. Enroll around 5500 COVID-19 patients (1000 outpatients and 4500 in-patients), which will allow to: 1.1 Phenotype patients with COVID-19 of variable severity 1.2 Assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among GPs in relation with their use of PPE 1.3 Evaluate the impact of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics COVID-19 severity 2. Use an electronic CRF (on RedCap) to record clinical, biohumoral and imaging data of inpatients with COVID-19 of various severity to explore the prognostic and pathophysiological role of immunologic factors, activation of blood coagulation, endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory response, genetic (ni particular X-linked), hormonal and metabolic factors, comorbidities and acute cardiac damage. Blood samples will be collected. We will also use machine learning techniques to develop multivariable models for patients' risk stratification 3. A follow-up visit at 3-6 months after discharge will be performed to identify residual clinical consequences that might affect long-term prognosis. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background COVID-19 has shown a lower case-fatality rate compared to other major viral outbreaks in contemporary history, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 2002-2003. However, the relative susceptibility to symptomatic infection and the case fatality risk increase substantially after 60 years of age, in men, and in overweight patients, raising questions about the underlying biology of host responses. This includes possible genetic derterminants of sex bias. Cardiac involvement, as characterized, by elevation of cardiac Troponin I and brain-type, natriuretic peptide, is frequent in COVID-19 and it is associated with worse prognosis. Myocardial injury and heart failure accounted for 40% of deaths in a Wuhan cohort, either exclusively or in conjunction with respiratory failure. Thus, it seems that cardiac involvement is both prevalent and of prognostic significance in COVID-19. However, both the actual incidence of myocardial injury (biomarkers elevation may simply reflect systemic illness in critically-ill patients) and the pathophysiology of cardiac involvement remain to be clarified. The SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts through the structural glycopeptides of the ""crown"" spikes with its cellular target that, in humans, is the angiotensin2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, expressed in particular in the heart and lungs. ACE2 is used by SARS-CoV-2 to be internalized by alveolar epithelial cells. Therefore, chronic intake of ACE inhibitors, or sartans, may influence the course of the COVID-19 disease because an increased expression of ACE2 (such as that induced by ACEi therapy) could facilitate the internalization of the virus and the progression of infection. However, the infection by the virus leads to the down-regulation of ACE2. The imbalance between ACE and ACE2 leads to an increase in angiotensin II, which binds AT1R, which increases pulmonary vascular permeability and lung damage. Thus, the role ACEi and ARBs on the susceptibility to SARS-COv-2 infection remain to be clarified. COVID-19 is characterized by changes in heart rate and cardiac autonomic modulation, systemic activation of inflammatory processes, with endothelial damage and involvement of cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory systems. Although most patients remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, in a subset of them the host inflammatory response continues to amplify with progressive lymphocytopenia, high white blood cells and neutrophil counts, to end-up with a systemic inflammation characterized by multiple organ failure and elevation of key inflammation markers (e.g. interleukin, tumor necrosis factor, interferon-y inducible protein, etc.). These biomarkers are not just indicators of inflammation, but are also associated with prognosis. Patients who died of COVID-19 showed higher levels of IL-6, ferritin and CRP. Moreover, biomarkers of myocardial injury and ECG abnormalities were associated with elevated inflammatory markers suggesting an indirect mechanism of cardiac injury. However, recent data have demonstrated the presence of the virus within the myocardium of some COVID-19 pts, implicating also direct myocardial injury. Also low Vit.D, with immunomodulating action, is associated with poor outcome. Another interesting aspect of the complex pathophysiology of COVID-19 is the finding that 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors in a Wuhan hospital showed overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is well known that sepsis is a common cause of DIC and inflammatory cytokines can promote the activation of blood coagulation in many ways. However, whether SARS-Cov-2 is more prone to DIC development and the role of anticoagulation in determining the prognosis in COVID-19 need to be established. Finally, no data is available on the short-term sequelae in COVID-19 pts after discharge, in terms of residual structural and functional cardiorespiratory damage and its determinants (viral, inflammatory, metabolic and pro-thrombotic factors). Hyphotesis and Significance We hypothesize that COVID-19 could represent a ""new"" CV risk factor inducing acute and chronic CV changes able to affect clinical evolution and long term prognosis. Suggested important mechanisms of COVID-19 severity related to injury of CV and respiratory systems include: 1) a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, with endothelial damage and DIC; 2) patients' demographic and clinical features (age, sex, body mass index, genetic factors, autonomic cardiac modulation, medical history in particular diabetes and CV diseases, sleep disordered breathing, low vitamin D levels, thyroid dysfunction, and current drug treatment); 3) evidence of cardiac damage during course of the disease. All these possible determinants of COVID-19 severity need to be systematically evaluated according to an integrated approach in a large number of patients developing COVID-19 of different severity, including inpatients and outpatients. Given the complexity of the hypothesized multifold pathogenetic mechanisms, also approaches to data analysis through artificial intelligence (machine learning algorithms) may allow to develop multivariable models to 1) effectively risk stratify patients to identify those at highest risk requiring more intensive support; 2) Promptly recognize patients most vulnerable for adverse outcomes, to prioritize palliative care and improve cost/effectiveness of healthcare resources deployed. Finally, no information is yet available on the short term residual structural and functional consequences on the immune, CV and respiratory systems following discharge of COVID-19 patients who have recovered from acute disease. Preliminary Data In spite of the widespread use of mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 and hypoxemia, hypoventilation is uncommon in these patients. Conversely, hypoxemia is usually accompanied by an increased alveolar-to arterial O2 gradient, signifying either ventilation-perfusion mismatch or intra-pulmonary shunting. The presence of a significant ventilation-perfusion mismatch is further supported in COVID-19 patients by the increase of PaO2 with supplemental oxygen. Whereas, when PaO2 does not increase with supplemental oxygen, presence of intra-pulmonary shunt is the most likely cause of hypoxemia. Moreover, preliminary data from China indicate that 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors in a Wuhan hospital showed evidence of DIC. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of tissue factor (TF), a glycoprotein activator of blood coagulation cascade present on surface of many activated cell types, and of circulating microvesicles (MV). COVID-19 appears characterized by predominantly pro-thrombotic DIC with high venous thromboembolism rates, elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen levels in concert with low anti-thrombin levels, and pulmonary congestion with microvascular thrombosis and occlusion on pathology and evidence of ischemic limbs, stroke, myocardial infarction in critically ill patients. D-dimer is a biomarker of coagulation activation triggered by TF but it does not identify per se the molecular mechanisms (venous or arterial) and/or the dysfunctional cell population involved. MVs have received increasing attention as novel players in CV disease (CVD). A subgroup of procoagulant MVs express also TF, predict CV events and identify patients at high recurrence risk. COVID-19 clinical manifestations are also similar to those of other autoimmune/inflammatory disorders in which a thrombophilic vasculopathy is sustained by systemic inflammation, with activation of the complement cascade. Also low levels of Vit D and thyroid dysfunction seem to characterize more severe disease. However, the cross-link between inflammation and coagulation, as well as the role of host biology, previous treatments and clinical history in modulating the clinical course of COVID-19 remain to be clarified. Aims 1. To investigate the epidemiological link of patients' clinical characteristics (gender, BMI, age, presence of CV risk factors, ongoing treatment, underlying CV diseases and myocardial injury) with outcomes. 2. To evaluate the pathophysiological role of: 1) activation of immune system and host inflammatory response; 2) activation of thrombotic and coagulation factors and endothelial damage (with possible DIC; 3) metabolic and endocrinologic factors, including thyroid dysfunction, low Vit.D (vs ARDS); 4) occurrence of sleep related breathing disorders and alterations in autonomic cardiac modulation; 5) genetic X-linked factors related to ACE2 expression and to gender bias 6) cardiac structural and functional changes as assessed by cardiac ultrasounds and MRI. Artificial intelligence methods will also be applied to risk-stratify patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 3. To identify the persistence of viral load, immunologic or coagulation alterations (plasma, cell or MV-related), and respiratory and cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19, by clinical/instrumental follow-up assessment at 3-6 months after discharge Sample size For Aim 1, in this epidemiologic survey we expect to include about 5500 patients: 4500 in-patients and 1000 out-patients. For Aim 2 and 3, because the context is underpinned by relatively sparse knowledge, ours will be considered as pilot assessments with no formal sample size calculation. For Aim 3 we will include roughly 3000 discharged patients Specific aim 1. Patients will be divided in two groups to identify outcome predictors. a) controls: individuals who did not develop severe COVID-19, b) cases: individuals who developed severe disease. The lack of enough knowledge in COVID- 19 patients about predictors of outcome limits the performance of standard regression models. Machine learning techniques can facilitate the objective interpretation of medical observations in building risk score. In particular, a combination of association rule mining with the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) can compute probabilistic associations between clinical features and outcomes. Statistical analysis Specific aim 2.To identify the relationship between each potential group of predictors and in-patients prognosis, we will apply multivariate logistic regression models. All association estimates will be reported as Odds Ratio (OR) and relative 95% confidence intervals. To address the problem of variable selection in high dimensional data (numerous predictors and confounders), we will use a new statistical approach based on random forest. To overcome problems due to uncommon outcome we will consider alternative regression model as log-binomial and Poisson regression with robust variance The development of a machine-learning algorithm to identify a new score of prognosis will be based on the above results and conducted on a subsample of in-patients with all potential predictors and phenotype. The sample will be randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) set. The training set will be used to build the score applying several machine learning algorithms. The score with the best predictive performance (C-index) on the validation set will be chosen by means of the two-tailed adequate hypothesis testing of equal predictive performance assuming I error type of 0.05 and power of 80%. When the null hypothesis will not be refused, the parsimony criterion will be applied. Specific aim 3. To characterize patients at follow-up in terms of viral load and alterations of immune or coagulative systems and respiratory/cardiovascular consequences, we will apply generalized linear mixed models which take into account the correlated response during time of the same patient, modeling appropriately the variance-covariance matrix of repeated measurements.",N/A

Comparison of Five Scoring Systems.,"INTRODUCTION. The novel coronavirus designated SARS-CoV-2, has determined an international outbreak of respiratory illness named Covid-19. Patients with Covid-19 present primarily with fever, myalgia or fatigue, and dry cough. Based on available data from 5% to 10% among hospitalized patients will require ICU admission. In this context of overflow of critically ill patients, it is mandatory to establish clear and objective criteria to assess and predict a Covid-19 patient's need for ICU admission, and potentially predict death occurrence. Early Warning Scores (EWS) are used in hospitalized patients to predict clinical deterioration. Several study demonstrate the utility of EWS in ED to predict patient outcome. AIM. The objective of this study is to evaluate five EWSs, to predict the need for ICU admission and the mortality in patients admitted in ED with COVID-19. METHODS. This is a single-center, retrospective observational study. We will review the clinical records of all the patients consecutively admitted to our ED for Covid-19 over a three-weeks period (March 1 to 21, 2020). We will exclude from study cohort patients aged <18 years old and pregnant women, and patients already on oro-tracheal intubation at ED arrival. Based on clinical records five EWS will be calculated: NEWS, NEWS2, qSOFA, MEWS, REMS. Study endpoints. The primary study endpoints will be death at 7 days, and need for ICU at 7 days, since ED admission. As secondary endpoints we will evaluate need for ICU and death at 24 and 48 hours since ED admission. Statistical Analysis Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be used to evaluate the overall performance of the selected EWSs in predicting the defined adverse outcomes. According to Youden's index we will estimate the optimal cut-off points and corresponding sensitivity and specificity at selected score threshold values. The comparison between the ROC AUCs will be made according to DeLong method. ***  *** Detailed Description *** INTRODUCTION After the first cases identified in Wuhan city (China) on December 2019, the novel coronavirus designated SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global epidemic of respiratory illness named COVID-191. To date, more than, 3,000,000 cases have been reported worldwide, including more than 300,000 deaths. Typical COVID-19 patients present with fever, myalgia or fatigue, and dry cough. Severe cases progress to severe dyspnoea and hypoxemia within one week after the onset of symptoms 3-5. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of hypoxemic respiratory failure is around 20%, and more than 25% of them may require intensive care treatment. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases has challenged the healthcare systems worldwide. Given the current overflow of critically ill patients in the Emergency Departments (EDs), an early identification of patients who need admittance to an intensive care unit (ICU) because of an increased risk of unfavourable outcome is necessary. Although general guidelines for ICU admission and triage exist, only limited guidance is available for the specific setting of COVID-19 patients. In this context of overwhelming demand for medical assessment and triage in ED, early warning scores (EWS) may be useful. EWS are based on a rapid and quantitative assessment of changes in vital signs, and were developed to identify and track patients at risk of deterioration in non-critical areas of the hospital in order to ensure an early stabilisation and ICU transfer when appropriate and prevent avoidable cardiac arrest. However, in recent years these scores have been used in ED to predict ICU admission and mortality. Use of EWS has recently been proposed for the triage of COVID-19 patients in ED. However, their usefulness has not been demonstrated yet. METHODS Study design This is a retrospective observational study conducted in the ED of the largest urban teaching hospital in Rome, a referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. The participants reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of all adults (>18y) patients admitted to ED for suspected COVID-19 over three consecutive weeks from March 1 to March 21, 2020, tested for COVID-19 according to the WHO interim guidance. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Study will include only patients whose diagnosis is confirmed with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Will be excluded from the study cohort pregnant women, patients discharged from ED with normal chest x-ray findings, and patients who were already mechanically ventilated on ED arrival. For patients with more than one access to our ED, only the latest access will be included in the analysis. Study variables The following information will be extracted from digital clinical records: age, sex, clinical history and presentation, temperature, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), arterial blood pressure (BP), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, oxygen therapy, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and chest x-ray findings.Clinical signs, including SpO2, will be assessed on arrival at the ED. National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), Quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) will be calculated for each patient. For NEWS2 calculation, patient will be considered at risk of type 2 respiratory failure if had a confirmed history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Study endpoints The primary study endpoints considered will be death or ICU admission within 7 days from arrival at the ED. Secondary endpoints will be death or ICU admission within 24 and 48 hours from ED arrival. Criteria for ICU admission The criteria for ICU admission of COVID-19 patients in include need for invasive respiratory support, or extra-pulmonary organ failure such as circulatory shock requiring vasopressors, or renal failure. These criteria are expected to be consistent throughout the study period. Statistical Analysis and sample size Continuous variables will be reported as median [interquartile range], and will be compared at univariate analysis by Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables will be reported as absolute number (percentage), and will be compared by Chi-square test (with Fisher's test if appropriate). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be used to estimate the overall performance of the evaluated scores in predicting the defined adverse outcomes. For each score threshold values will be calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), and negative likelihood ratio (-LR). The Youden index will be used to estimate the optimal cut-off points for sensitivity and specificity. The comparison between the ROC AUCs will be made according to DeLong method. A p value ≤ 0.05 will be regarded as significant. Data will be analyzed by IBM SPSS statistics v25® (IBM, IL, USA). Sample size. For a correct estimation of ROC Curve a minimum of 50 patients for each endpoint should be included in the analysis. Given the estimate flow of at least 300 COVID-19 confirmed patients in the study period, and the actual rate of ICU admission in these patients (about 20%), the sample should be adequate for statistical estimation. Aim of the study The objective of the present study is to assess the ability of EWS to predict ICU admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients in the emergency department.

The research portion of the study is the evaluation of PRC support through a repeated survey completed by consenting staff. Investigators will test the effectiveness of the PRC by measuring trends in burnout and other effects of stress over the course of the study in a subgroup of hospital workers (as many as consent, target ~1000 people) through an online questionnaire (called ""How Are You?""). (2) The second intervention is an enriched version of the ""How Are You?"" Survey, which provides personalized feedback about coping, interpersonal interactions and moral distress. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive the shorter Express Survey (identifying data and outcome measures only), or the Enriched survey (all of the Express measures plus additional measures with feedback based on responses). It is hypothesized that both the PRC intervention and the Enriched Survey intervention will help prevent or reduce instances of burnout in HCWs. ***  *** Detailed Description *** This project studies the impact of two interventions, the addition of Peer Resilience Champions to other hospital supports and an interactive computer-based learning intervention that provides personalized feedback about relevant interpersonal and psychological characteristics of participants. The Peer Resilience Champion (PRC) Intervention Investigators will second or hire an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals (e.g. nurses, social worker, or infection control professional, total of 1 FTE) to serve as Peer Resilience Champions. These Champions will receive coaching and then ongoing supervision in the relevant aspects of stress management, peer support, and resource navigation by expert members of the research team based on existing evidence. Peer Resilience Champions will act predominantly at the level of clinical units and departments. The activities of Peer Resilience Champions will, in part, be modelled on the role that psychiatrists acting as support coaches have played in during the acute phase of the pandemic. These include support, identification of needs, education, advocacy and resource navigation. In doing so, the Champions follow evidence-based principles and guidelines. The model is to provide quickly responsive, adaptive, peer support because it is expected that the needs of staff will change over the course of a pandemic and in its aftermath. Peer Resilience Champions will work in an expanding selection of hospital locations, following a randomized cluster (stepped wedge) design until the resource is available to the entire organization. People who work and learn at Sinai Health do not need to participate in this study in order to receive the potential benefits provided by Peer Resilience Champions, which will be provided irrespective of study participation. The effectiveness of Peer Resilience Champions in reducing burnout and other outcomes will be tested using outcome measures included in the feedback staff survey (see below), which is completed by consenting participants in this study. Interactive Computer-based Learning Intervention A staff survey which includes all primary and secondary outcomes measures will be completed by consenting participants at intervals of approximately 3 months seven times (over approximately 21 months). Participating staff will be randomized 1:1 to receive only these measures with no feedback (the Express Survey) or these measures plus additional measures of interpersonal and psychological characteristics, with personalized feedback (the Enriched Survey). Feedback is based on previous experience from the investigators in providing feedback from validated measures completed online to both healthcare workers and the general public. The purpose of feedback is to encourage self-reflection, especially with respect to coping and interpersonal interactions. The core measures that are common to both the Express and Enriched surveys serve to tests the effectiveness of the Peer Resilience Champions Intervention. The effectiveness of the Interactive Computer-based learning intervention will be tested by comparing the core measures between those receiving the Express Survey and those receiving the Enriched Survey. Peer Resilience Champion Support The study design provides a controlled comparison of support as usual to PRC support. Using a randomized cluster (stepped wedged) design, usual staff support will be compared to that of PRC. PRC operates largely at the level of the clinical units and groups, and so a randomized cluster design is preferable to a randomized controlled trial. The stepped wedge design allows clusters of hospital staff/volunteers to receive the PRC intervention in a random sequence until the resource is available to all areas of the hospital. This intervention will take place at Sinai Health System, including the Mount Sinai (approximately 4500 employees), Bridgepoint (approximately 1200 staff), and Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI) (approximately 1200 staff). Five clusters of clinical units and departments will be constructed that are approximately balanced between hospital units and staff groups with (i) high COVID patient acuity (ICU, Emergency, medical units with negative pressure rooms) or high exposure to patients from community with unknown COVID status (Family Medicine, Labour and Delivery), (ii) all other clinical patient care areas, (iii) non-patient care areas, and (iv) areas in which most or all staff are/were temporarily restricted from attending the hospital (e.g. LTRI, volunteers). After survey participants (and their disciplines and clinical units) are identified (T0 survey), their corresponding units, will be grouped into one of the five clusters in order to meet the above goals. These clusters will then be randomized in order to determine the order of intervention implementation. Each cluster will either receive support as usual or PRC for a period of three months, followed by the completion of a survey questionnaire given at seven different time points (T1-T7) spaced by three months. NOTE - justification for choosing a non-blind comparison: Since the Express Survey is shorter than the Enriched Survey, participants are not blind to survey cohort assignment. Nor does the design control for time spent on an online activity. It would be possible to control for the duration of the survey by expanding the length of the control condition and this would also allow for the possibility of a blind comparison. However, a longer control survey would increase the risk of drop-out among participants in the control condition because completing surveys without interaction or feedback is not interesting. Since maximizing continued participation in serial surveys is critical to testing the PRC intervention hypothesis, a non-blind test of the Enriched Survey intervention hypothesis is preferable to increasing the risk of being underpowered to test the PRC hypothesis. Feedback Surveys Immediately after consenting, participants will be asked to complete the T0 survey that asks about identifying information, and the characteristics of the participant's work at Sinai Health. The T0 survey also collects an email address, to which all subsequent surveys (T1 to T7) are sent. Following receipt of the T0 survey, participants are randomized to receive either the Express Survey (T1 to T7) or the Enriched survey (T1 to T7). In either case, T1 is sent soon (~1-2 weeks) after T0. All subsequent surveys are sent at approximately 3-month intervals. T0 survey - The initial survey collects identifying data (non-binary gender, discipline, department, age, marital status), years of experience, SARS experience, number of people in household and information about COVID-19 experience to date (exposure to patients, experience with isolation of self or family members, testing etc.). Two free optional text write-in questions provide allow participants to describe more about themselves or their experience (past experience surveying healthcare workers post-SARS was that many were keen to write at length about their experience, beyond data collected more formally, and that insights from this open-ended reporting were valuable for placing quantitative results in experiential context during analysis and knowledge dissemination phases). The T0 survey takes about 10 minutes to complete plus whatever time is spent providing optional free-text answers. Express Survey: The express survey includes validated measures of the primary outcome, the emotional exhaustion scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The Express Survey also includes measures of secondary outcomes: sleep, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, psychological distress, occupational resilience, and COVID-19 prevention and control self-efficacy (using an instrument revised from a measure of self-efficacy used in preparation for an expected pandemic. The survey is the same each time it is completed (T1 to T7) at 3-month intervals. The Express Survey takes about 10 minutes to complete. Enriched Survey: The Enriched Survey contains all of the measures included in the Express survey. No feedback is provided from any of these measures (i.e. this portion of the Enriched survey is identical to the Express Survey). In addition to these core outcome measures, the Enriched Survey includes measures of personality, interpersonal style and coping and provides personalized feedback based on scores at time points T1 to T6. The interactive measures included vary from one survey time point to the next in order to provide variety, and to cover a larger number of participant characteristics within the limits of reasonable survey time burden. State-dependent characteristics which may change over time (coping, interpersonal problems) are measured twice. A measure of lifetime experience with moral distress and a measurement of attachment, a stable trait, occur only once. The Enriched T1 to T6 surveys take about 10-20 minutes. Sample size This study is powered to test hypothesis 1, which is expected to require a larger sample size than testing hypothesis 2. There are over 6000 staff at Sinai Health. Assuming a starting proportion of 30.4% of staff with high burnout (based on previous studies), an 80% power, and an alpha level of 0.05, five clusters of 200 staff providing measures per cluster is sufficient to detect a drop of ≥ 9.4% (with an intracluster correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.01), ≥10.7% (ICC of 0.015), or ≥ 11.9% (ICC of 0.2). These ICC estimates are congruent with previous studies. These differences are consistent with a post-SARS study that found high burnout in 30.4% of exposed and 19.2% of unexposed HCWs. Five clusters of 200 staff (n=1000) would require <17% of staff to consent to participate and complete the measures.",N/A

Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together have significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage over 6 days compared to a placebo and COVID-19 patients who received a 5 day regimen of 400mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine had significantly shortened times to clinical recovery characterized by improved pneumonia compared with patients who did not receive Hydroxychloroquine. Within OSF Healthcare approximately 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are currently receiving some form of Hydroxychloroquine during the course of their hospitalization. The utilization of this treatment has been approved by the FDA based upon the limited data available. Significance: The optimal treatment regimen for COVID-19 patients has yet to be defined. Several small studies have indicated a potential role for the utilization of Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, very little evidence exists around the optimal treatment regimen and efficacy with regard to tangible outcomes. This observational retrospective/prospective chart review study aims to help provide epidemiological data that may help to provide guidance to clinicians for both future patients, as well as provide clinicians guidance for study design of more definitive controlled studies. Given the rapid spread of this disease, the high mortality rate associated with it and the impact of the disease upon society this study is anticipated to have the potential to contribute significantly to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Study Design and Methodology: The study will be a retrospective/prospective observational study of cohorts of hospitalized patients across the OSF Healthcare System who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit signs or symptoms of respiratory distress during the course of their hospitalization. The outcomes of patients who both receive and do not receive Hydroxychloroquine will be compared, with particular attention to the timing of administration in relationship to the onset of respiratory distress. Respiratory distress will be defined as a low SpO2, an elevated respiratory rate or an increased oxygen demand. Hydroxychloroquine administration will be defined as a documented administration of the medication on the patient's medication administration record (MAR).

Observational study of this would be significantly limited and therefore unlikely to be undertaken) - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (some indication that these lead to poorer outcomes) Study Procedures: OSF Data Analytics will pull reports of confirmed positive COVID-19 subjects. The data will be kept securely on password-protected computers and analyzed by applicable research personnel listed on this study. Data Use and Management: 1.

This new coronavirus causes a disease presentation which has now been named COVID-19. The virus has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11th March 2020. As of 18 March 2020, there are 198,193 number of confirmed cases with an estimated case-fatality of 3%. There is no approved therapy for COVID-19 and the current standard of care is supportive treatment. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the cell entry receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2) to access and infect human cells. The interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein is not in the active site. This process requires the serine protease TMPRSS2. Camostat Mesilate is a potent serine protease inhibitor. Utilizing research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the closely related SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanism, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked by camostat mesilate. In mice, camostat mesilate dosed at concentrations similar to the clinically achievable concentration in humans reduced mortality following SARS-CoV infection from 100% to 30-35%.",Phase 1/2

In these patients, the lungs become severely inflamed because of the virus. The inflammation causes fluid from nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in the lungs, making breathing increasingly difficult. This fluid forms small clots in the air sacs, creating a barrier until the cells regenerate. In some patients, this clot does not disappear in a timely fashion or interferes with the development of the new cells. Furthermore, the small clots in the air sacs obstruct the air and oxygen getting deep into the lungs, interfering with proper ventilation. The trial will recruit patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS. Eligible patients (or if patients lack capacity, their legal representative) will be provided with an information sheet and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility will be mainly assessed via routine clinical assessments. Patients will receive a nebulised version of a type of drug called tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) that is inhaled using a nebuliser. This is normally a drug used to break down blood clots. In this situation though, it might be useful for stopping clots forming in the lungs, because these might lead to even more difficulties with breathing. The first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to standard of care (SOC). The second group of 12 patients will receive SOC alone as a comparison. To evaluate efficacy, the improvement of oxygen levels over time and safety will be be monitored throughout. Blood samples will be taken to measure markers of clotting and inflammation in both groups. From the end of the treatment phase (after Day 3) both groups will be followed up in accordance with SOC. ***  *** Detailed Description *** This is a phase II, open label, single centre, uncontrolled, repeated dose, pilot trial of nebulised rt-PA in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. The study will recruit patients requiring either IMV or NIV. Eligible patients (or if patients lack capacity, their legal representative) will be provided with an information sheet and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility will be assessed via routine clinical assessments, which may have been done prior to consent. The only exceptions are a pregnancy test (blood or urine), and possibly any assessments that were not done as per routine care. These must be done following consent, and all screening assessments must have been done during the 24-hour period before dosing with rt-PA. The first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to SOC. The second group of 12 patients will receive SOC alone as observational arm, to ensure that any changes are not entirely due to disease resolution. Within each group 6 patients will be receiving IMV and another six will be receiving NIV. A statistically powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be ideal to define the magnitude of benefit and impact on overall survival and is the typical design in patients with ARDS. Although there is clinical data on the safety of nebulised rt-PA, but there is no clinical data in this clinical condition to facilitate a sample size calculation. There is data from a small RCT that has used another fibrinolytic agent, but the doses are not comparable. When a patient is randomised to receive no treatment, this precludes participation in other interventional studies which might decrease the risk of mortality. The most recent figures suggest a 50% mortality in patients receiving IMV there is 50% mortality. Currently there is a concerted effort to introduce multiple therapies based on our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of disorder. Further, if this pilot study shows significant effect in a subset of patients, there would be justification to progress to a statistically powered RCT. In the event of major adverse drug reactions or minor improvement in the oxygenation as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 , there are minimal gains to be had with a larger randomised control study. For patients in the rt-PA group, 10 mg of rt-PA dissolved in 5 ml of diluent will be given every 6 hrs for 66 hrs. Dose modifications will not be permitted. Efficacy will be assessed by the monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation. Safety monitoring will be performed by assessment of the incidence and severity of bleeding events, and by the monitoring of plasma fibrinogen levels and routine coagulation parameters. Additional samples will be taken for exploratory assessment of potential biomarkers, including (but not restricted to) PAI- 1, alpha 2 antiplasmin and a range of inflammatory cytokines and coagulation proteins. All other monitoring will be done as per SOC. From the end of the treatment phase (after Day 3) both groups will be followed up in accordance with SOC. Although there is extensive experience with the use of nebulised rt-PA in the context of the underlying inflammation, safety measures been included. A gap of 24hrs will be maintained between first and second patient. At 24hrs if patient 1 has no evidence of major pulmonary bleeding suggesting exaggerated alveolar fibrinolysis and no evidence of fibrinogen reduction of more than 50%, suggestive of systemic absorption a second patient will be dosed. Both patients will be evaluated for 72 hrs for major pulmonary bleeding and if no bleeding is noticed than the rest of the cohort can be recruited after the review of the safety data by the trial management group comprised of the investigators. If there are any concerns with the data this will be referred to the DMC for review. If the safety profile is acceptable, dosing of the third and subsequent patients in the rt-PA group will resume with no required interval between patients. Efficacy will be described as a relative improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (or SaO2/FiO2) ratio assessed at day 5 and day 7 after start of treatment. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be set-up to review safety data within the trial along with the final study results and advise on progressing from a pilot study to a randomised control trial based on the safety and efficacy data that is collected. The DMC will receive weekly reports on bleeding complications, both major and minor along with fibrinogen levels. If at any time a patient has major pulmonary bleeding, further dosing of patients will be stopped and an adhoc DMC review will be arranged before resuming dosing (see section 12.2 Data Monitoring Committee).",Phase 2

In this phase, any evolutions of ECG alterations of the acute phase will be described and the relationship with cardiac involvement will be assessed. ***  *** Detailed Description *** In the early months of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 virus infection quickly spread around the world to a pandemic. On 2 April 2020, confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide exceeded one million and an unprecedented health crisis has occurred in recent history. SARS-CoV-2 disease can lead to the development of even severe pneumonia with the need for ventilatory support and in some cases fatal outcome. From the data currently present in the literature, important relationships emerge between infection and cardiovascular diseases. COVID-19 patients with underlying pre-existing heart disease or cardiovascular risk factors have a more severe course of the disease and are more at risk of adverse outcomes and death than individuals with no history of heart disease or risk factors. During the course of the infection, some patients even without previous heart disease may experience myocardial injury and this leads to a significant increase in in-hospital mortality. Myocardial pain during SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. To date, there are no data on the role of the electrocardiogram neither in the diagnosis of cardiac involvement nor in predicting the prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether there are basal electrocardiographic features capable of correlating with the course of the disease and the prognosis is currently unknown. The development of electrocardiographic changes during the course of the disease and their possible prognostic significance has not currently been described. The present study involves three different phases of evaluation of the electrocardiographic (ECG) traces of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. - Phase 1: it is proposed to collect and retrospectively analyze the ECGs of hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection which led to invasive ventilation or patient death as a consequence and, if available, also possible troponin dosage; - Phase 2: aims to collect and analyze the ECGs of consecutive hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluate their relationship with the course of the disease, cardiac involvement and prognosis; - Phase 3: it is proposed to repeat ECG and to carry out echocardiogram to patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3 months from hospital discharge by simultaneously performing, if deemed clinically indicated, also cardiac magnetic resonance.

At the discretion of the clinician who manages the patient, transthoracic echocardiogram and / or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging will also be performed. A formal calculation of the sample size is not possible due to the total lack of data. Furthermore, since it is an observational project, the calculation of the sample size is not mandatory.

This trial is designed to generate point prevalence of infected (I) persons, independent of clinical symptoms. The susceptible (S) class is the number of COVID-19 tested by any FDA-approved NP swab test or a SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody test. At present FDA does not have approved SARS-CoV serology and such serology is not used for diagnosis of acute infection. The recovered (R) class is the number of positives. This information allows for modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in NC. The investigation is not testing the effectiveness or safety of either of these testing modalities, though serology may be offered in the future by UNC Healthcare laboratories. The blood samples to be obtained assess development of host response to SARS-CoV2 infection. ScreenNC will be implemented within the logistic and clinical limitations of the current outbreak. This is a single visit study. Since there is a shortage of PPE the investigators will rely on screening at locations different then the screening of presumed infected persons. Additionally, due to logistical considerations, volunteers may have a viral swab (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal) and/or a blood sample obtained. Thus, at recruitment, volunteers may be asked to give both samples or only one. Viral load testing will be done at LabCorp and/or UNC labs using compatible assays (Roche, ThermoFischer , WHO). Confirmatory testing (other PCR, sequencing, culture) will be done at UNC. Blood samples will be tested at the McClendon Clinical Immunology laboratory for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2. Because these patients are in the UNC Health Care system, The investigators will have access to their medical records, which will provide very granular information as to co-morbidities and other demographic factors which can be assessed in the context of SAR-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection status.

It involves wearing a watch-like device on his/her wrist and answering questions or doing tasks to measure mood and other mental health symptoms, and suicidal thoughts. In the second phase, the investigators will call the participant around 12 months after s/he has left the hospital.

RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of Veterans will be conducted to determine if the previously-identified specific actigraphy-based measurements highly associated with suicidal ideation in non-Veterans will predict suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and/or rehospitalization in Veterans. METHODS: An analysis of Veterans admitted to the Bedford, Massachusetts VAMC acute psychiatry unit will be conducted. The primary analysis will focus upon Veterans with current suicidal ideation or recent suicidal behavior (SI/SB) who do not have a primary psychotic disorder, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease, and who are not undergoing alcohol detoxification. A separate analysis will be conducted of patients undergoing alcohol detoxification, half with SI/SB and half without SI/SB. Participants will wear a small, unobtrusive, wristwatch-like actigraph on their nondominant wrist, and complete self-rated and clinician-rated assessments of suicidal ideation, as well as self-rated assessments of the severity of other psychiatric symptoms. A Resiliency Index (RI) will be calculated using nonlinear dynamic analysis of the amplitude of movements over time frames from 6 minutes - 2 hours. These time frames are the periods for which a clear structure to the movement data is evident, with patients with suicidal ideation showing less variation in amplitude than patients without suicidal ideation. If medications given for alcohol detoxification are determined to not interfere with the RI, then a secondary analysis will examine the entire sample of Veterans. One Aim will focus upon determining whether the original Resiliency Index or alternative movement data indices, such as one based on the change in the movement data over the hospitalization, predicts the presence and severity of suicidal ideation among Veteran inpatients. This aim will also examine the sensitivity and specificity of the RI for detecting the presence of any suicidal ideation, and of substantial suicidal ideation. (In non-Veterans, the RI showed a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 100% for detecting any suicidal ideation, and 86% and 88%, respectively, for detecting substantial ideation). In addition, the investigators may determine whether the RI predicts subsequent suicidal behavior or rehospitalization over different time periods within the original 12 month followup period, alone or combined with data about symptom severity, past history, and the present hospitalization.",N/A

The objective of this study is to provide scientific information regarding the possible risk factors in these patients, as a large part of them receive immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments. The main objective of this study is thus to determine the epidemiological (eg, age, form of disease, disability) and pharmacological (related to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments) factors favoring the occurrence of a severe form of Covid-19 in MS and NMO patients. ***  *** Detailed Description *** There are currently no data on the consequences of coronavirus infection in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or NeuroMyelitis Optica (NMO) spectrum disorder. Numerous questions have emerged regarding the management of immunoactive therapy in the case of infection or suspected infection related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, the recommendations issued by the French MS Society are to maintain the disease modifying therapies (DMT) for MS and NMO, but a case-by-case discussion with the expert neurologist for suspected or confirmed COVID+ patients remain highly recommended. Besides DMT, neurological disability could also be a risk factor for severe infection, regardless of the age of the patient. It is therefore essential to have epidemiological data to describe the characteristics of the clinical expression of coronavirus infection (Covid-19) and factors enhancing the occurrence of severe forms in patients with MS or NMO during of the 2020 pandemic. This study involves all hospital and neurologists ensuring the follow-up of patients with MS and NMO via the 23 CRC-SEP and associated hospital centers. This multicenter study is based on an already functional network organization, grouping together around forty hospital centers, participating either in the French MS registry (OFSEP), or in the French MS Society (SFSEP).

In patients with ARDS who are mechanically ventilated invasively through a tracheal tube and with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure to inspired oxygen fraction ratio) of less than 150 mmHg, prone positioning significantly reduced mortality. Furthermore, nasal high flow, a non-invasive respiratory support and oxygenation technique, reduced the need for tracheal intubation and reduced mortality among the most severe patients (PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 mmHg) suffering from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Prone positioning of ARDS patients treated with nasal high-flow was evaluated in 20 patients with predominantly viral pneumonia.

Respiratory complications occur in 15 to 40%, the most serious is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The management of COVID-19 is essentially symptomatic with respiratory oxygen supplementation in mild forms to invasive mechanical ventilation in the most severe forms. Prone position (PP) reduced mortality in patients with ARDS in intensive care. Ding et al showed that PP and high flow oxygenation reduced the intubation in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. The investigators hypothesize that the use of PP in spontaneously ventilation patients under oxygen standard could decrease incidence of intubation or non-invasive ventilation or death compared to conventional positioning management in medical departments. ***  *** Detailed Description *** This is a multicenter randomized controlled study. 400 patients with COVID-19 documentation and undergoing oxygen therapy will be randomly assigned, with a 1:1 ratio, to conventional positioning or repeated prone sessions. The control group will have conventional positioning: semi-seated in bed or seated in a chair. The prone position is not allowed during the day (it is allowed at night if it is the natural sleeping position). The intervention group will have: - Repeat sessions of 30 min to 1 hour of PP followed by 2 hours of conventional position. The goal is 5 sessions of prone position over the day between 7 am and 10 pm. - The maximum of prone position at night. Patients must be able to take position by themselves or with minimal assistance. The rails will be positioned in order to prevent falling out of bed.

Recently a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as responsible of an initial epidemic respiratory disease, named COVID-19, in China since the 31 December 20191. COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a some countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan 2 . Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact and the COVID -19 epidemic is gradually taking hold in France 3. There is very little data so far to determine whether people living with HIV (PLWHIV) are at greater risk of COVID-19 acquisition or severe disease. HIV infection is associated with deficiencies in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity that could potentially alter the course and severity of common infections. Although use of cART partially restores immune system, HIV-infected persons may remain at increased risk for morbidity associated with viral illnesses, especially if the ability to generate antigen-specific responses remains impaired 5. Additional factors, such as the high prevalence of smoking and chronic lung diseases among such patients, may further predispose HIV-infected patients to respiratory tract infections. Finally, they could be considered more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection because their immune systems are already under strain and cannot avoid the possibility of atypical presentations in these patients. Thus, we would like to implement a research as soon as possible concerning PLWHIV in order to adapt the care of these patients as fast as possible.

Moreover, Chloroquine has the characteristics of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory by inhibiting the production of TNF-α along with IL-6. In the first half of February, a study illustrated puissant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500-mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. According to the news briefing of a study, it was indicated that chloroquine phosphate actually outdo the control treatment in inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation, improving lung imaging findings, and curtailing the disease course. Another study evaluated the possible doses of CQ and HCQ to find the optimized dose in treatment of COVID-19. They revealed that while within in-vitro settings Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day divided in two separate doses, which was three-fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days. The new study published in 16th March, pointed out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID-19. In spite of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID-19. The reported clinical benefits of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for patients with COVID-19 come either from media reports or nonrandomized trials with small numbers of participants (<100 patients). The documented benefit of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin is very limited, especially in severe disease. While these medications, individually or in combination, may prove efficacious, these benefits need to be established with randomized clinical trials prior to widespread adoption of these treatments.

To date, no randomized controlled trials have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. Systemic Sclerosis can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Many people with scleroderma are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (> 40% have interstitial lung disease) and common use of immunosuppressant drugs. The objective of The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate a videoconference-based intervention designed to improve symptoms of anxiety and other mental health outcomes among individuals with systemic sclerosis at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will be conducted using an existing cohort of systemic sclerosis patients. We will use a partially nested design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background: Social distancing and movement restrictions during contagious disease outbreaks are necessary to reduce spread but can lead to negative social and psychological outcomes, including loneliness, depression, and anxiety, particularly in vulnerable populations. An online survey that used snowball sampling techniques and collected data from 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China in January-February 2020 found that over 50% rated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as moderate or severe. Symptoms of anxiety were rated as the most common psychological problem. Self-reported poor physical health status and the presence of a chronic illness were associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. Onset typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and approximately 80% of people with SSc are women. SSc can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Disease presentation is extremely heterogeneous, and the course of the disease is highly unpredictable. People with SSc commonly experience hand function and mobility limitations, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, pruritus, symptoms of depression, and body image distress from disfiguring aspects (e.g., skin tightening, pigment changes, hand contractures, telangiectasias). Many people with SSc are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (> 40% have interstitial lung disease) and common use of immunosuppressant drugs. The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program is a group videoconference-based intervention designed to improve symptoms of anxiety and other mental health outcomes among individuals with SSc at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective of the SPIN-CHAT Trial is to evaluate the effect of the program compared to waitlist control on patient reported symptoms of anxiety as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety 4a v1.0 scores. Recruitment and Enrolment: SPIN is a collaboration of SSc researchers, health care providers, people living with SSc, and patient organizations from Canada, the United States, Europe, Mexico and Australia that has assembled a large multinational patient cohort to collect longitudinal data on patient-reported outcomes in SSc and as a framework for embedding RCTs of e-health interventions. SPIN Cohort participants complete online assessments upon enrolment and at 3-month intervals. To date, over 2000 SSc patients from 47 centres have been enrolled in SPIN's web-based cohort (currently approximately 1800 active participants). SPIN Cohort participants will be invited by email and by popups to enrol in the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Additionally, recruitment announcements for the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort will be posted on SPIN's social media and distributed through our patient organization partners. All SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants will be invited to complete measures at baseline and every two weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. They will receive email reminders to complete bi-weekly follow-up assessments. Participants in the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort eligible for the SPIN-CHAT Trial will be provided with a brief description of the trial in the SPIN-COVID-19 Qualtrics platform and will be asked if they would be interested in participating in the trial. Those who express interest will be provided with an online version of the trial consent form, which they can also download, and will be given the options of (1) consenting to participate; (2) declining participation; or (3) requesting that a member of SPIN's research team call them to answer questions they have about participating in the trial before consenting. Methods: The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic, two-arm partially nested RCT (PN-RCT) that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort. Pragmatic RCTs are conducted to replicate real-world delivery of interventions as much as possible and support decisions on whether interventions should be provided in practice. The trial will be a PN-RCT because participants randomised to the intervention arm will be clustered into intervention groups, and members of each intervention group will interact during videoconference sessions; participants randomly assigned to the waitlist control will not be clustered and will only complete trial measures. Random Selection and Allocation: SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants who provide consent for participation will be entered into different pools based on their availabilities and taking into consideration time zone differences. Once there are enough participants to complete an intervention group and assign an equal number of participants to waitlist control, SPIN personnel will provide the external service with an anonymised list of participants (only identification numbers will be provided) who could participate in an intervention group based on language and day and time availabilities. For each intervention group and waitlist control pairing, the service will randomly select 16 participants from the pool of enroled participants available based on language, day, and time and will randomly allocate 8 to the intervention group and 8 to the waitlist group using block randomization.This process will be repeated until trial enrolment is complete. One intervention and waitlist control pairing will include 18 participants (9 intervention, 9 waitlist) to accommodate the total number that we anticipate randomizing. Intervention and Comparator: Mental health outcomes, including anxiety, among people in quarantine are associated with modifiable factors such as degree of isolation, boredom, and ability to manage worry and anxiety. In addition to psychological strategies, including worry reduction and meditative exercises, exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety. Among older adults, where isolation is a common challenge, activity and social engagement are commonly used to address loneliness and feelings of isolation. Recommendations for the World Health Organization and major national public health organizations for managing mental health during COVID-19 emphasize setting and following a routine, managing information sources and quantity, staying connected with others, and finding a way to be physically active. The SPIN-CHAT Program is a brief group videoconference intervention that was developed based on best-practice principles for managing anxiety and worry, recommendations for maintaining mental health during COVID-19, and input from the SPIN COVID-19 Patient Advisory Team. Educational segments in each session will be delivered by a research team member with experience and training related to the topic. Leisure activities that will be done at the start of each session will include games (e.g., Pictionary, charades), creative activities (e.g., roll-a-story), cultural activities (e.g., virtual museum tours), social activities (e.g., share your favourite recipe). In the healthy information management and social connection segment, strategies will be provided and discussion will be facilitated on how to stay informed via accurate information sources while avoiding sensationalist and other non-helpful information. Information on using simple (e.g., phone) or more advanced technology (e.g., group videoconferencing) to stay connected will be discussed, along with strategies for connecting regularly with others. The managing worry segments will include an overview of worry, including what it is, the difference between helpful and harmful anxiety or worry, how to identify triggers of worry, and strategies to manage worry, including identifying different types of worrying, using worry journals, worry postponement, and worry time. Exercises will be done with the group to illustrate techniques. In the relaxation segments, an introduction to the purpose of relaxation techniques will be presented, and participants will be guided through brief breathing, mindfulness, and visualization exercises. The physical activity segments will include an overview of the physical and psychosocial benefits of physical activity for maintenance of health for chronic disease management, including mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic; movement guidelines to ensure safety; and how to monitor daily physical activity. Participants will be guided through movement options for the home-based setting, including warm-ups, aerobic, and strength activities. Behaviour change techniques to foster building the habit of moving more at home will be taught, including goal-setting, scheduling, addressing barriers, and building social support. Activity engagement sessions will be guided by the leisure education content model. Sessions will involve interactive group discussion about the benefits of leisure engagement for persons with SSc, addressing physical, social, emotional, intellectual and spiritual realms of health and wellbeing. Sessions will explore barriers to leisure for persons with SSc and includes tips for finding leisure resources within the participants' own homes, both in-person and online. Sample Size: Effects of short anxiety-focused interventions in post-disaster settings are between 0.40 and 0.80 standardized mean difference (SMD). This is larger than estimated minimally important difference for the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 score (SMD = 0.23 to 0.34 SMD). For an assumed effect size of SMD = 0.50, a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, and an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, N=146 provides 80% power or greater for our primary outcome, PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; assuming 10% dropout, we will recruit 162 participants (81 in 10 SPIN-CHAT groups; 81 waitlist). We believe that this is a conservative power and sample size estimate. First, in cluster RCTs, ICC values for individual patient outcomes are typically lower than our 0.05 estimate. If the true ICC is lower than our 0.05 estimate, this will result in greater power than estimated. Second, there has been no loss to follow-up in the feasibility trial or initial waves of our full-scale trial of the videoconference-based SPIN support group leader program, which has a similar design. Thus, we believe that a 10% loss to follow-up may be conservative. Data Analysis: Analyses will be conducted by a statistician blind to trial arm allocation. For the primary outcome analysis, we will use an intent-to-treat analysis that compares all patients randomly assigned to the SPIN-CHAT Program to all patients assigned to the waitlist control. The intervention effect at 4 weeks will be estimated using a linear mixed model, adjusted for baseline PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scores. The model will include a random effect to account for clustering of participants in the training groups, but not for participants in the waitlist control arm, because there is no clustering in the control arm. We will investigate the effects of missing data using multiple imputation. As a secondary analysis, we will additionally adjust for age, sex, baseline loneliness, baseline boredom, and baseline physical activity. Analyses of secondary outcomes will similarly be done (1) controlling for baseline scores only and (2) controlling for baseline scores, age, sex, and other key baseline measures. Statistical significance for all analyses will be determined based on two-sided α = 0.05. In addition, we will use complier-average causal effect analysis to estimate effects among patients who use the intervention compared to similar patients in the waitlist arm of the trial.",N/A

Our clinical tool would enable to identify potential multi-drug interactions and potentially reduce the risk of adverse drug events (ADE) developing in elderly patients infected with COVID-19. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Certain investigational agents have been described in observational series or are being used anecdotally based on in vitro or extrapolated evidence. It is important to acknowledge that there are no controlled data supporting the use of any of these agents, and their efficacy for COVID-19 is unknown. FDA-approved drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, monoclonal IL-6 antibodies, JAK inhibitors, thalidomide and the new investigational drug, remdesivir have been proposed for repurposing to fight COVID-19 and its complications. A medication risk stratification strategy will be used to simulate the impacts of different potential repurposed drugs for COVID-19 on the Medication Risk Score (MRS) which is used as a predictive tool for ADEs. A retrospective study will be conducted using de-identified drug claims data of elderly patients with polypharmacy. Patients meeting all the following criteria will be included: 1. Patient enrolled in a PACE organization during the implementation period; 2. PACE organization contractually receiving pharmacy services from CareKinesis; Exclusion Criteria a) No drug claims data available for the period of 2019-2020 This retrospective cohort will utilize 178,867 drug claims from approximately 12,123 patients enrolled in PACE. MRS will be calculated using the last available 3-month period of drug claims in 2019. The data elements required for the calculation of the full set of risk scores are: prescribed drugs, dose, age, gender. Medication risk stratification using 5 factors will be performed to obtain the MRS. Various repurposed drugs (drugs associated with the highest probability or efficacy or shown interest as per their inclusion in current clinical trials will be prioritized) will be added to the patient drug regimen except for the patients that are currently taking the repurposed drug. A new MRS will be generated for all stratified patients.",N/A

The project is divided into a clinical component comprising the study of the immune response in different populations and a cellular component focusing on the in vitro study of different immunomodulating treatments on their ability to induce an anti-viral Th1 ***  *** Detailed Description *** Since March 2020, Europe has been facing the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious disease of viral zoonosis type, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-21. This virus is responsible for an epidemic in Wuhan in November 2019 and a pandemic in March 2020. The mode of transmission, both respiratory and by contact, carried by microdroplets emitted by an infected person and inhaled by a person nearby, induces a very high contagiousness rate2. In the majority of cases, CoV-2-SARS infection is not very symptomatic, but some evolve into severe forms, particularly in frail people: elderly subjects, those affected by chronic diseases (diabetes, obesity or cancer) or those undergoing immunosuppressive treatments. There is still little information on the reasons why some will develop a severe form while others will remain asymptomatic. The immune response is little studied in this context. Functional study of the cellular immune response has shown its interest in predicting the risk of infection in different cohorts, particularly in renal insufficiency subjects awaiting transplantation with an over-risk of developing an infection within a year in patients with a low level of gamma interferon (INFγ: main anti-viral cytokine) after non-specific stimulation of T lymphocytes. A study published the clinical characteristics of 41 patients infected with coronavirus at the Huanan seafood market (first contact cases). Despite a similar clinical symptomatology: cough (76%) and fever (98%), some patients required rapid ventilatory assistance. These patients had an increased production of inflammatory cytokines: IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα3. Here, the objective is to identify cytokine profiles in subjects exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 that can predict their risk of developing a severe pauci-symptomatic form at the time of exposure or during the development of a severe form. the team believes that the immune response to this infection is a major factor in the risk of developing an asymptomatic infection, a flu-like symptomatology or a respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS).3,4 The team believes that the immune response to this infection is a major factor in the risk of developing an asymptomatic infection, a flu-like symptomatology or a respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS). The team thus wishes to better direct patients to appropriate care structures to optimise the care pathway (ambulatory, infectiology, intensive care), respirators and number of beds so as not to overload the staff) and to enable treatments to be personalised and adapted as best as possible: corticosteroids, immunomodulators, antivirals. The study will be based on 2 axes: a first clinical axis (i) and a cellular axis (ii). In its clinical part (i), the intensity of the immune response in COVID19 subjects presenting different forms of the disease (asymptomatic, moderate and severe forms) will be measured. These subjects will be recruited from two different patient populations: - Subjects at risk of infection with CoV-2-SARS. We will test the Th1 response of caregivers at the time of their entry into a COVID-19 service by measuring the level of INFγ released after non-specific T-cell stimulation. The hypothesis is that a high level of INFγ at the time of exposure prevents the risk of developing severe disease and directs the patient towards less symptomatic forms. Thus, thanks to serological tests, it will be possible to determine retrospectively in this group how many subjects presented an asymptomatic form and thus to determine with the help of a functional test mimicking a viral infection the level of IFNγ measured after stimulation. - Patients with CoV-2-SARS infection hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department with a moderate form or in resuscitation with a severe form of COVID.19 The evaluation of these patients on admission using a functional test mimicking a viral infection the rate of IFNγ measured after stimulation will be carried out. The levels of IFNγ measured after stimulation will be compared in these 3 groups of COVID19 patients if the evolution towards inflammatory cytokinic profiles at D0, D5 and D10 can predict the risk of developing ARDS... Then, the impact of different therapeutic interventions on the secretion of INFγ will be tested in vitro in an ancillary study (ii): anti-inflammatory, corticosteroids, anti-IL6, IL2, IL7, chloroquine on their capacity to produce anti-viral cytokines of the type INFγ on different T cells while limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by cells of innate immunity, from healthy subjects, COVID-19 subjects with a mildly symptomatic form or COVID-19 subjects with ARDS.",N/A

In the past three months, the virus has spread rapidly worldwide to reach the pandemic threshold. Research has since been carried out and is intensifying in order to describe the clinical characteristics of infected patients, to identify the prognostic factors of acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] and the death; and to assess the effectiveness of new antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19.

However, it is not known if early administration of HDIVC could prevent progression to ARDS. We hypothesize that HDIVC is safe and tolerable in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) subjects given early or late in the disease course and may reduce the risk of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS along with reductions in supplemental oxygen demand and inflammatory markers. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, potential efficacy of high dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) therapy for patients with COVID-19 and decreased oxygenation. COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with numerous prediction models suggesting potential shortages in ventilators, ICU beds, and high rates of hospital mortality. Case-series suggest sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are driving hospitalizations, morbidity (ICU beds, ventilator use, organ failures), and mortality. A therapy is urgently needed to be given early in the disease course in order to attenuate the infectious and inflammatory process, reduce risk of intubation, and reduce progression of organ failure and ARDS. By administering HDIVC at the first objective sign of worsening oxygenation, documented by change in peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio (S/F) or decreased SpO2 at baseline (mild hypoxia group), HDIVC may reduce the inflammatory process and development of respiratory failure requiring intubation. We will also enroll patients already in respiratory failure on ventilators (severe hypoxia group) and document safety and tolerability in both cohorts. By calculating ventilator and ICU-free days, we can potentially signal clinically relevant endpoints that could be used in larger trials needed to answer a crucial therapeutic question—can early administration of HDIVC in COVID-19 lead to faster recovery or improve outcomes? Moreover, we will document change in inflammatory markers that are elevated in COVID-19 (d-dimer, CRP, LDH, liver enzymes, and ferritin) to develop a mechanistic understanding and risk stratification of response to HDIVC infusion. Ultimately, if HDIVC is deemed safe and tolerable in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects, a larger clinical trial will be indicated. AVoCaDO will produce safety and tolerability data to test HDIVC in a multi-center, rapid, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with COVID-19.",Phase 1/2

Many obstetrics and gynecology patients are additionally experiencing increased stress due to the healthcare changes the COVID-19 pandemic has caused including delayed or canceled elective surgeries, visitor restrictions, and telemedicine visits instead of in person clinic visits. Mindfulness meditation is a self-management strategy that can be utilized by anyone to assist with the management of stress. Mindfulness meditation mobile applications, such as the ""Calm"" app, can be used to help manage stress, especially during this uncertain time. The investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating perceived stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbance in the investigators outpatient OB/Gyn patients at Banner Women's Institute, with the use of a 30 day trial of the mindfulness meditation app, ""Calm."" All patients would ultimately receive a 30 day free trial of the mobile meditation app, however the intervention group would receive the 30-day free trial immediately and the control group would receive the 30-day free trial after the study period which is 30 days after enrollment. The investigators additionally want to evaluate the feasibility of using the mobile app, including looking at adherence to use of the app and patient satisfaction with use of the app. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The COVID-19 global pandemic is at the top of many people's minds and is presumably effecting the stress level of most Americans during this time of uncertainty. The COVID-19 public health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led to several healthcare changes that affect obstetrics and gynecology patients, including delays and cancellations in elective surgery, visitor restrictions, and transitioning from in person outpatient visits to telemedicine visits. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) joined with several other OB/Gyn societies to announce their joint statement on March 16th, 2020 to reduce the number of elective surgeries in OB/Gyn to free up healthcare resources. Hospitals and outpatient clinics are instituting visitor restrictions. Specifically, at Banner University Medical Center - Phoenix (BUMCP), they are not allowing any visitors with the exception of one visitor for an obstetric laboring patient or for pediatric patients. All ""non-essential"" OB and Gyn visits are transitioning to telemedicine visits through the telephone or video conferencing platforms, with the exception of obstetric visits that require labs, vitals, or fetal assessments. These healthcare changes to OB/Gyn patients is likely impacting their level of stress. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for all patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects, tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps) may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2). ""Calm"" is a mindfulness meditation mobile app that offers a range of mindfulness meditation practice guide modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. The app includes meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds. Few studies on the use of ""Calm"" exist and include a randomized controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study evaluating cancer patient's perceptions of the app (1,3). There is limited literature on the effects of mindfulness meditation in obstetrics and gynecology and include its effects on postoperative pain, infertility, and painful bladder (4-6). During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mindfulness meditation mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in OB/Gyn patients, although this requires further investigation. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the mindfulness meditation app ""Calm"" on stress, anxiety, and sleep in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will be randomized to two groups; Arm 1 receives a 30 day free trial at the start of the study, Arm 2 receives a 30 day free trial at the conclusion of the study. All participants will complete a baseline survey on perceived stress, anxiety, and sleep at the start of the study, again at 2 weeks into the study, and again one month later. The investigator's primary objective is to evaluate perceived stress (validated Perceived Stress Scale) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, ""Calm,"" among outpatient OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator's secondary objectives are to evaluate anxiety (validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and sleep (validated PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, ""Calm,"" among outpatient OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the investigators want to assess feasibility with using the app which includes measurements of adherence and participant satisfaction with use of the app.",N/A

This registry includes approximately 2500 northern Alberta patients with inflammatory arthritis who receive highly complex therapies which may be associated with side effects. This program of data collection and research has been evaluating the effectiveness and safety as well as associated health care costs of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis patients since 2004. The principle investigators are based at the University of Alberta while the co-investigators are academic rheumatologists at the University of Alberta. The registry has approximately 900 patients taking anti-malarials combined with their complex therapies and ~ 1500 not on anti-malarials in combination with their complex therapies. We aim to perform a case control study evaluating the impact of anti-malarial drugs (eg. hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) on the development of COVID-19 compared to those patients who are not on anti-malarial drugs over the next 6-12 months. In addition to frequent e-mail surveys screening for the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and understanding their concomitant arthritis medication use, we will compare the healthcare outcomes of both groups of arthritis patients with and without COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic. This information will provide critical information beyond an anecdotal level on whether or not anti-malarials truly provide a protective benefit against COVID-19 or reduce the severity of infection. A blood sample from all participants (Covid-19 positive and negative) will be drawn approximately six months into the study for measurement of antibodies to Covid-19 and possible blood types and HLA alleles. Additionally, this study will be linked to another study ""Persistence of SARS-Cov2 in immunocompromised patients"" which will specifically evaluate COVID-19 serology and nasopharyngeal swab findings in the subset of patients who develop COVID-19. ***  *** Detailed Description *** PURPOSE: 1. To evaluate the impact of anti-malarial medications (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) on the development and severity of COVID-19 infection during the current COVID-19 pandemic in an inception cohort registry of northern Alberta rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis patients who are on complex biologic therapies for the duration of the pandemic. 2. To further evaluate the impact of all biologic medications currently in the registry on the development and severity of COVID-19 by mechanism of action (eg. TNF antagonism vs IL-6 blockade, etc). HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the ""case"" group of patients on concomitant anti-malarial treatment with their biologic agent will have a lower incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection compared to those not on anti-malarials based on anecdotal reports of efficacy of anti-malarials on COVID-19 infection from international reports. JUSTIFICATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced unforeseen challenges internationally and led to great uncertainty for patients who are immunocompromised, such as patients in the RAPPORT registry. Recent anecdotal reports from other countries have been associated with media and political escalation of the potential benefit of anti-malarial drugs on the course of COVID-19 infection. This has led to threats to the supply of anti-malarials drugs for patients with rheumatic diseases like lupus and rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, where the benefits are proven. The RAPPORT inception cohort registry provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in an immunocompromised population, while also evaluating the potential impact of possible treatments for COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Primary 1. To evaluate the impact of anti-malarial medications (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) on the development and severity of COVID-19 infection during the current COVID-19 pandemic in an inception cohort registry of northern Alberta rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis patients who are on complex biologic therapies for the duration of the pandemic. 2. To further evaluate the impact of all biologic medications currently in the registry on the development and severity of COVID-19 by mechanism of action (eg. TNF antagonism vs IL-6 blockade, etc). Secondary 1. To evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 versus other infections over the remaining duration of the pandemic in an immunocompromised population. 2. To compare the incidence of COVID-19 versus other infections over the remaining duration of the pandemic in the proportion of patients from the RAPPORT registry who take concomitant anti-malarials versus those patients that do NOT take anti-malarials. 3. To compare the impact of different mechanisms of action of biologic medications within the RAPPORT registry, on the incidence of COVID-19 versus other infections RESEARCH METHOD/PROCEDURES: For this case control study, we have identified ~900 patients within the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry who are taking concomitant anti-malarial medications with their biologic medication compared to ~ 1500 patients who are NOT taking concomitant anti-malarial medications. The current consent for the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry allows patients to be contacted for their potential participation in future studies. Based on this consent, we aim to send a letter to all existing RAPPORT patients inviting them to participate in this study. This letter will be sent by email to those with an associated email address and by Canada Post mail for those who do not. Similar to previous surveys we have conducted, the letter will provide a synopsis of the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic and request for the patient to consent to the following: (1) consent to receive email/letters with surveys of their clinical status at week 0 (the first point of contact), week 2, then every 4 weeks until the pandemic is over according to the World Health Organization or most appropriate local declaration and (2) consent to allow the study team access to the patient's medical health records (Connectcare/Netcare) for the duration of the pandemic to provide complete information regarding any healthcare utilization, investigations and outcomes over time. The act of consent will be obtained if the patient answers specifically that the study team can access their records and by the act of completing the survey every time. We will collect a blood sample when the pandemic is over from the consenting patients for consideration of serology testing. The survey will screen for clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and concomitant status of their inflammatory arthritis and medication use. This information is linked by a unique identifier with the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry. The RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry collects baseline, and at least annual information including patient demographics, ethnicity, disease characteristics, serologies, and patient-reported outcomes evaluating the impact of arthritis on their activities of daily living. With the additional linkage to their electronic medical records, we aim to identify the following: hospitalizations, and laboratory and diagnostic investigations. Access to the entire cohort's electronic medical records will provide the opportunity to capture patients who may not develop any symptoms consistent with COVID and/or may not be keen to participate in ongoing surveys but may be impacted by COVID-19. The subset of patients who develop COVID-19 will be contacted to participate in the associated study (Persistence of SARS-CoV2 in immunocompromised patients; Dr. M. Osman) for more in-depth serological evaluations and nasopharyngeal swabs. At the end of the study, we will collect a blood sample as well to ensure that COVID-19 serological evaluations are completed on asymptomatic individuals who participated in the study. The survey, developed in collaboration with Infectious Disease experts (Drs. Sonpar, Swartz, Shafran, Singh), will screen for currently recognized signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, confirmation of current arthritis medication use including all disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) as well as biologics will be captured. Surveys will be completed on REDCAP through email link, provided directly on the email or as a hyperlink that the patient can type in if they receive the survey by Canada Post. The REDCAP survey will be developed and housed by EPICORE (Epidemiology and Research Coordinating Center). For the remainder of the pandemic, electronic medical record and NETCARE searches will be conducted for all consenting patients with pre-specified outcomes and interim investigations and/or procedures or hospitalizations in Alberta Health Services facilities. REDCAP survey responses will be collated with these searches. PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS: A response rate of 40% is expected for this study. Descriptive data analyses will be conducted to describe the population of inflammatory arthritis patients divided between those who are currently taking an anti-malarial and those who are not. The registry provides information including demographics (gender, age, ethnicity) and at least annual disease activity status with validated disease activity scores which differentiate between low disease activity state/remission and mild, moderate and severe disease activity. Co-morbidities through the Charlson Comorbidity Index will be identified and compared between groups. Survey results over the pandemic per patient will be analyzed. Electronic medical records will be reviewed at least monthly for all consenting patients to identify and quantify investigations, procedures and healthcare resources utilized during the pandemic. With multivariate analyses, the impact of anti-malarial use on the development and severity of COVID-19 will be evaluated between the two groups, adjusting for important confounders including the following: co-morbidities (eg. cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes), biologic mediations, steroid use and other DMARDs. Further stratification by biologic DMARD might be conducted. Healthcare utilization between groups will be compared over time. Quantification of antibodies to Covid-19 will be compared between the anti-malarial and non-anti-malarial groups.",N/A

We are working with Mologic Ltd, who have been funded by DFID/Wellcome Trust to develop a rapid, accurate and low cost, lateral flow assay (LFA) to detect viral circulating antigens and IgM/G against SARS-CoV-2 in less than 15 minutes. These POC/PON tests are intended for the rapid triage of patients with fever and/or cough and to identify patients likely to be immune from previous infections. In addition to this the POC/PON tests will be designed as self-tests, offering the additional benefit of enabling wide deployment in the home and community settings. In addition, we will evaluate ELISA assays, also produced by Mologic to detect IgG and IgM (and possibly IgA) against SARS-CoV-2. Comparison of antibody and antigen dynamics over time will compare with ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR. ***  *** Detailed Description *** On 12 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This coronavirus was later named SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a non-segmented, positive sense RNA virus and part of the family of coronaviruses. Similar to the Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, it binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor located on type II alveolar cells and intestinal epithelia. SARS-CoV-2 can result in a severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which is characterised by diffuse alveolar damage and direct viral cytopathic effect on pneumocytes. Some patients who develop COVID19 may respond with a fulminant ""cytokine storm"" reaction. As of 23 March 2020, a total of 374,921 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 168 countries with a total of over 16,411 deaths (case fatality amongst confirmed cases of 4.4%) (John Hopkins's Coronavirus Resource centre). Over 293,425 cases and 13,258 deaths have been reported from countries outside mainland China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared on the 12th of March the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a pandemic in the context of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [4]. Europe has rapidly become the epicentre of the pandemic and in the UK, cases are increasing daily. There have been 6,724 confirmed cases in the UK as of 23 March 2020, including 190 confirmed inpatients at St George's Hospital NHS Trust (23 March 2020 , Dr. Breathnach, personal communication). Because of the lack of a validated serological test, the actual number, and therefore the proportion, of people that develop asymptomatic infection remains unknown. This means that an accurate case fatality estimate remains elusive. Due to the rise in the number of diagnostic samples, tests are taking longer than expected. Among the foremost priorities to facilitate public health interventions is a reliable laboratory diagnosis. Prompt case ascertainment is necessary to ensure rapid and effective contact tracing, implementation of infection prevention and control measures according to WHO recommendations, and collection of relevant epidemiological and clinical information. Because of the lack of a validated serological test, the actual number, and therefore the proportion, of people that develop asymptomatic infections remains unknown. This means that an accurate case fatality estimate remains elusive. Due to the rise of the number of samples to diagnose, tests are taking longer than expected. Among the foremost priorities to facilitate public health interventions is a reliable laboratory diagnosis. Prompt case confirmation is necessary to ensure rapid and effective contact tracing, implementation of infection prevention and control measures according to WHO recommendations, and collection of relevant epidemiological and clinical information. The experience in China has been that around 15% of patients with confirmed infection develop severe disease and around 5% become critically ill. In the UK, a modelling analysis by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team suggests that even with the implementation of self-isolation measures (household quarantine and social distancing) the surge limits for both general wards and ICU beds will be exceeded 8-fold. Furthermore, a relaxation of these mitigation measures is likely to lead to a rebound of cases until there is an effective vaccine - which is not expected for some 12-18 months. We can therefore clearly expect a significant number of inpatients with COVID-19 infection in the UK in the coming months. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody lateral flow assay (LFA) development has been led by Mologic, a company based in Bedford. We will use prototype LFA and ELISA that are ready for preliminary evaluation, and subsequently use these tests on-site to evaluate the test at POC. LFA have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in throat/ nose swabs and detection of IgG and IgM in blood/serum and SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, IgG, IgM and IgA in saliva. Saliva is an exciting sample to use as it is far easier to use than blood or throat / nose swabs for potential self-testing. Additionally, it is currently unknown why some patients develop severe COVID-19, while others affected by the same SARS-CoV-2 infection display only mild symptoms. Co-morbidities such as hypertension, kidney disease and diabetes have been linked to poorer prognosis and clinical outcomes. However, a proportion of patients of younger age and without comorbidities also develop severe disease- and there is a need for greater understanding of the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infection is important. The use of diagnostics developed within this study will improve the management of cases of COVID-19. The LFA are rapid, easy to use and designed to be affordable globally. The rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 with antigen detection will allow patients to be rapidly triaged in hospital, GP surgeries and other places such as immigration areas. They are sufficiently cheap to be appropriate for use in low- and middle-income countries. The use of antibody detection will allow both for diagnosis of immunological response to acute infections as well as after patients have recovered later . To utilise these tests appropriately an understanding of dynamic immunopathological changes over time is necessary. Characterisation of immune response and susceptibility and its association with viral clearance and disease progression on in large cohorts with varied disease severity is important to assist clinical risk prediction outcomes and evaluate the potential for novel immunotherapeutic interventions. Immune response characteristics may have predictive and prognostic value, with early adaptive immune responses possibly correlated with improved clinical outcomes.",N/A

Sero-epidemiological studies can identify patients that have been infected with SARS-CoV2, regardless of the severity of their illness. These studies are needed to provide estimates of herd immunity that are essential for public health policy makers. The antibody response is crucial for preventing viral infections and may also contribute to combat infection. The first seroepidemiological studies in adults in the Netherlands are being initiated, but there is currently no data on immunity in children. Evidence is emerging that while children suffer less severely from COVID-19, they do get infected, can spread the virus, and elicit IgG, IgM, IgA or secretory IgA responses. Differences in the humoral response to SARS-CoV2 in between children and adults may partly explain the difference in disease severity.  ***   Objective: To evaluate circulatory and mucosal antibody responses against SARS-CoV2 in children during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. ***    ***   Study design: Multicenter prospective cohort study ***    ***   Study population: Children younger than 18 years of age in whom blood is drawn for routine medical care in one of the participating hospitals are eligible for participation.  ***    ***   Main study parameters/endpoints: IgG, IgM, IgA and total neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in blood and secretory IgA levels against SARS-CoV2 in saliva from all participants ***    ***   Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: ***   This study is classified as an observational study in subjects under 18 years of age. We will ask additional blood to be collected if the patient has blood tests ordered by the treating physician in routine medical care. The child will not be subjected to additional dermal or vena punctures for this study. Blood can be obtained when the child presents to the emergency department, during hospitalization, or in the outpatient clinic of the participating hospitals. We will ask for an additional 1 ml of blood in children aged 0-1 years, 2 ml in 1-5 year olds, and 5 ml in 5-18 year olds. Simultaneously, a saliva sample with a buccal swab will be sampled. The burden to participate in this study is therefore negligible.

The greatest uncertainty of all calculation models on hospitalisation rates, morbidity and mortality of the pandemic is the unknown number of unreported cases of citizens infected or having been infected with Covid-19. Currently the direct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the mouth/nose/throat swab using PCR is established worldwide with high sensitivity and specificity. This direct method is expensive and not always available in sufficient quantities. Furthermore, the results are strongly influenced by the quality of the smear collection. The detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an alternative method for determining whether a person has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and has developed an immune response to the virus. Recently several companies have been offering such kits for sale. According to national experts, these kits have not yet been sufficiently clinically validated, which is why valid data on their sensitivity and specificity are not yet available. However, on the validation of these tests are being worked hard all over the world, so that it can be assumed (the experts also agree on this) that data on the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody tests will be available in the foreseeable future. Probably the only reasonable and feasible method of testing the actual rate of Covid-19 infection in a given population is to detect infection (either directly or indirectly by means of antibody testing) from a sample that is as representative as possible for this population. The selected subjects of the LEAD study, the core project of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Health at Otto Wagner Hospital (the hospital association is an official partner of the institute), represent an exemplary representative sample of the general population in Vienna (i.e. the sample corresponds to the Viennese population in terms of age, gender, smoking habits, place of residence, etc.). In the LEAD study, more than 11,000 subjects (aged 6-80) mainly from Vienna were subjected to a ""Health examination survey"" (2). Due to the conditions described above, blood should be drawn from the subjects of the LEAD study at two points in time (as early as possible and after two to three months) and blood sera should be frozen to determine antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and tested with a test of high sensitivity and specificity. According to the WHO this procedure (longitudinal cohort study with serial sampling of the same individuals (in the same geographic area) each time) is recommended in that provides the most comprehensive information on extent of infection. By testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies twice in the subjects of the LEAD study (random sample), an accurate and representative estimate of the actual positive Covid-19 cases in the Viennese population and the rate of spread during the pandemic could be extrapolated for Vienna in the foreseeable future. Since more than 1,500 individual parameters were measured in the participants of the LEAD study, conclusions on socioeconomics, lifestyle factors and possible risk profiles (e.g. co-morbidity, smoking behaviour, etc.) can be drawn from those who tested positive (but also negative). In addition, a query regarding symptoms should be carried out at both dates in order to obtain information on the percentage of asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2.",N/A

Still, so far no systematic analysis has been carried out answering the question as to whether or not these patients suffer from secondary HLH and could potentially benefit from immunomodulatory drugs.",N/A

ARDS is common in severely ill patients in Intensive Care Units and is associated with a high mortality and a high morbidity in those who survive. ARDS occurs in approximately 20% case of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. There is a large economic burden with direct healthcare costs, but also indirectly due to the impact on the carer and patient through the patients inability to return to full time employment. There is little evidence for effective drug (pharmacological) treatment for ARDS. There is increasing information that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might be important in treating ARDS. REALIST will investigate if a single infusion of MSCs will help in the treatment of ARDS. The first step will be to first of all determine what dose of MSCs is safe and then divide patients suffering from ARDS into two groups, one of which will get MSCs and the other a harmless dummy (or placebo) infusion, who will then be followed up to determine if lung function improves. If effective this may lead to further research to determine if MSCs are effective in patients with ARDS. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The role of MSCs as a novel treatment in ARDS. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are a mononuclear cell population that have the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages, and bone, cartilage and adipocyte cells in particular. Cell-based therapies have been termed the ""next pillar of Medicine"". MSCs constitute an innovative approach with substantial therapeutic promise for ARDS. MSCs possess several favorable biological characteristics, including convenient isolation, ease of expansion in culture while maintaining genetic stability, minimal immunogenicity and feasibility for allogenic transplantation. MSCs reduce inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance during rodent and murine bacterial pneumonia, and augment repair of the animal and human lung. Large animal studies have also replicated these beneficial effects. Bone marrow derived (BM) hMSCs decreased acute lung injury (ALI), without producing organ toxicity, in endotoxin injured pigs. Two randomised small phase 1 studies of plastic adherent MSCs in patients with ARDS have taken place. In Japan, investigators used adipose-derived plastic adherent cells in a small cohort (n=12) of patients with ARDS randomized 1:1 to MSCs or placebo: showing that the cells were safe and well-tolerated in this patient group, and were associated with reduced plasma levels of the alveolar epithelial cell injury marker SP-D. In the US Matthay has completed the phase 1 START trial, using a dose escalation study of plastic adherent bone marrow derived MSCs, in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. START showed that marrow derived MSCs at similar doses to those proposed in this study are safe and well-tolerated, (n=9), with a trend to reduced lung injury in the group treated with the highest (10x106cells/kg) compared with the lower doses, 1-5x106cells/kg. Current (20 March 2020) data on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that it causes a mortality rate of ~3.4%, compared with <0.1% with seasonal influenza. ARDS occurs in approximatel 20% cases of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. In a restropective multi-centre study of 150 confirmed cases in Wuhan, China, ARDS occured in significantly greater proportion of non-survivors 81% (55/68 patients) compared with only 9% survivors (7/82 patients); p<0.01. In another study of 193 confirmed COVID-19 cases, ARDS was observed at a significantly higher rate in non-survivors 93% (50/54 patients) compared with survivors, 7% (9/137) patients; p<0.0001. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, MSCs have been administered in a pilot study of seven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A single infusion of 1 x 10^6 MSCs were administered intravenously when their condition was considered to be deteriorating despite other treatments, however only 1 of the 7 patients required critical care and mechanical ventilation. 4 patients were described as severe with compromise of respiratory function. Patients underwent follow up for 14 days and no infusional toxicity or adverse events were reported. Trial design: The phase 1 trial is an open label dose escalation pilot study in which cohorts of subjects with moderate to severe ARDS will receive increasing doses of a single infusion of Realist Orbcel-C in a 3+3 design. We initially plan 3 cohorts with 3 subjects/cohort. Planned doses for the 3 cohorts pending absence of safety concerns are 100 x 10^6 cells, 200 x 10^6 cells and 400 x 10^6 cells. In the completed Phase 1 REALIST trial, infusion of 400 million cells was achieved without any dose limiting toxicity at day 7 and has been approved by the DMEC as the intervention for this study. The phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, allocation concealed placebo-controlled study using the 400x10^6 cell dose of Realist Orbcel-C in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19. Primary objective: To assess the safety of a single intravenous infusion of REALIST ORBCEL-C cells in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. Secondary objectives: In patients with moderate to severe ARDS to determine the effect of a single intravenous infusion of REALIST ORBCEL-C cells on: 1. Physiological indices of respiratory dysfunction reflecting severity of ARDS, as measured by oxygenation index (OI), respiratory compliance, and P/F ratio. 2. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. 3. Extubation and reintubation 4. Ventilation free days at day 28 5. Duration of ventilation 6. Length of ICU and hospital stay 7. 28-day and 90-day mortality Population: Patients will be prospectively screened daily. All patients with moderate to severe ARDS will be entered into a screening log. If possible during the phase 2 trial, all patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19 will be entered into a screening log. If the patient is not recruited the reason will be recorded. A fully anonymised minimal dataset will be recorded on these patients (age, gender, APACHE II score, worst P/F ratio at time of assessment, reasons for non-enrolment and vital status). APACHE II score and vital status will be collected using anonymised linkage to the ICNARC database through a defined CMP number (or equivalent). This will allow comparison to identify that the study population is representative of the overall cohort of patients. This information is required to establish an unbiased study population and to ensure the study can be reported in keeping with CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org). Patient consent: Informed consent procedure: The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The chief investigator (CI) (or designee) is responsible for ensuring that informed consent for trial participation is given by each patient or a legal representative. An appropriately trained doctor or nurse may take consent. The person taking informed consent must be GCP trained, suitably qualified and experienced and have been delegated this duty on the delegation log. Appropriate signatures and dates must be obtained on the informed consent documentation prior to collection of trial data and administration of the trial drug. If no consent is given a patient cannot be randomised into the trial. The incapacitating nature of the condition precludes obtaining prospective informed consent from participants. In this situation informed consent will be sought from a Personal Legal Representative or Professional Legal representative. Personal legal representative consent: Informed consent will be sought from the patient's personal legal representative (Per LR) who may be a relative, partner or close friend. The Per LR will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and provided with a copy of the covering statement for the Per LR with an attached participant information sheet (PIS) and asked to give an opinion as to whether the patient would object to taking part in such medical research. If the Per LR decides that the patient would have no objection to participating in the trial the Per LR will be asked to sign the Per LR consent form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the Per LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical records. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there are likely to be visiting restrictions in place due to infection control measures and therefore it may not be possible to obtain consent from the PerLR at the clinical site. If the PerLR is not available at the site, the research may contact the PerLR by telephone and seek verbal agreement. The verbal agreement will be recorded in the PerLR Telephone Agreement Form. Professional legal representative consent: As the patient is unable to give informed consent and no Per LR is available, a doctor who is not connected with the conduct of the trial may act as a professional legal representative (Prof LR). The doctor will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and given a copy of the PIS. If the doctor decides that the patient is suitable for entry into the trial that doctor will be asked to sign the professional legal representative consent form. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the Prof LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical records. Retrospective patient consent: Patients will be informed of their participation in the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team once the patient regain capacity to understand the details of the trial. The responsible clinician or a member of the research team will discuss the study with the patient and the patient will be given a copy of the PIS to keep. The patient will be asked for consent to participate in the trial and to sign the consent to continue form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the patient and another copy placed in the patients' medical records. Where consent to continue is not obtained, consent from the legal representative will remain valid. If the patient refuses consent, permission to use data collected to that point and to access medical records for trial data will be requested from the patient. Withdrawal of consent: Patients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by Per LR or Prof LR) from the trial at any time without prejudice. In the event of a request to withdraw from the study, the researcher will determine which elements of the trial are to be withdrawn from the following possibilities and this will be documented: - Orbcel-C administration if ongoing - On-going data collection during hospital admission - Confirmation of vital status - On-going data collection following hospital discharge In the event that the request is to withdraw from all elements of the study, only anonymised data recorded up to the point of withdrawal will be included in the study analysis. Consent will also be requested to use the samples collected to that point. Investigational medicinal product The Investigational Medicinal Products are: 1. Allogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as a sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension containing a fixed cell dose of either 100 x 10^6, 200 x 10^6 or 400 x 10^6 cells in 10mL, 20mL or 40mL volumes, respectively to be further diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for the purposes of administration. 2. Plasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls) as the placebo control solution. Storage, thawing and reconstitution of Orbcel-C cells: Trial guidelines will provide detailed information regarding the protocol for storage, thawing and reconstitution, and administration of the cell product Orbcel-C and placebo. Drug storage: The study drug will be commenced as soon as possible following reconstitution and within 6 hours. Study drug termination criteria: Study drug will be continued until one of the following is met: 1. Study drug related adverse event 2. Death or discontinuation of active treatment 3. Request from Per LR or Pro LR to withdraw the patient from the study 4. Decision by the attending clinician on safety grounds. Study drug compliance: Any omission of the study drug will be recorded in the CRF to monitor compliance. Study drug accountability: The site clinical trials pharmacist and cell therapy facility staff will maintain full accountability for the study drug received, prepared and dispensed to patients in ICU. Records will be kept allowing traceability between the cell donor and the IMP recipient. Drug administration will be recorded on the patient's prescription chart. Study drug return and destruction: Any partially used study drug should be disposed of/destroyed at the site in accordance with Trial guidelines and local biological waste management policies. Unused product should disposed of/destroyed under the supervision of the site clinical trials pharmacist. Records of return and destruction will be maintained. Data Quality: The NICTU will provide training to site staff on trial processes and procedures including CRF completion and data collection. Within the NICTU the clinical data management process is governed by SOPs to ensure standardisation and adherence to International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements. Data is to be entered onto the electronic database as per the CRF entry timelines. On-site monitoring visits during the trial will check: (i) the accuracy of the data entered into the CRF, (ii) entries against source documents alongside adherence to the protocol, (iii) trial specific procedures and (iv) Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This monitoring will be carried out as per the trial specific Monitoring Plan. Changes to data will be recorded and fully auditable. Data errors will be documented and corrective actions implemented. Data validation will be implemented and discrepancy reports will be generated following data entry to identify data that may be out of range or inconsistent, or protocol deviations, based on data validation checks programmed into the clinical trial database. For routinely collected clinical data the NHS record will be the source document and for study specific measurements the CRF will be the source document. Data management: The PI (or designee) will collect all data and record this in the CRF. Each participant will be allocated a unique participant study number at trial entry, and this, and initials, will be used to identify him or her on the CRF for the duration of the trial. Data will be collected from the time of trial entry until hospital discharge. Trial data will be entered onto a CRF and processed electronically as per NICTU SOPs and the study specific Data Management Plan (DMP). Submitted data will be reviewed for completeness and entered onto a secure, backed-up custom database. Due care will be taken to ensure data safety and integrity, and compliance with GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Data queries will be raised electronically. The designated site staff will be required to respond to these queries within 2 weeks and send them back to the CTU after the queries have been reviewed and signed by the CI/delegated staff member. Any amended information will then be entered in the study database. A copy of the signed data query form should be retained with the CRF at the investigator site. If the participant is transferred to another hospital the PI or designated member of the site study team will liaise with the receiving hospital to ensure complete data capture as per CRF instruction. If this is not possible, the primary outcome must be collected as a minimum. CRFs are to be submitted to the CTU as per the CRF submission schedule. Data censorship for each trial will occur 90 days post randomisation. Analysis Population The primary analysis will be conducted on all outcome data obtained from all participants regardless of protocol adherence, i.e. intention to treat analysis. It is possible that some enrolled subjects may not be treated with study drug. Therefore a secondary analysis of the all-treated population analysis will be undertaken. For the Phase 1 trial no formal statistical analysis will be performed on safety data. The primary analysis will be descriptive and will focus on adverse events. The number of pre specified cell infusion associated events will also be reported. Descriptive analysis of pulmonary and non-pulmonary organ function will also be undertaken. We plan to publish the data from the phase 1 study. In the completed Phase 1 REALIST trial, infusion of 400 million cells was achieved without any dose limiting toxicity at day 7 and has been approved by the DMEC as the intervention dose for this study. For the Phase 2 trial, adverse events will be reported as for the Phase 1 study. For continuously distributed outcomes, differences between groups will be tested using independent samples t-tests and analysis of covariance with transformations of variables to normality if appropriate, or non-parametric equivalents. Chi-square tests (or Fisher's Exact tests) will be used for categorical variables. A p value of 0.05 will be considered as significant. Correlations between changes in the biological markers measured and physiological and clinical outcomes will be assessed by appropriate graphical and statistical methods including Pearson's (or Spearman's) correlation coefficient. A final analysis and report of the Phase 1 study is planned following the last patient's 90 day follow up. A final analysis and report of the phase 2 study is planned following the last patient's 90 day follow up. The 2 year follow up data will be published thereafter and will be an important long term outcome. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and approved by the independent DMEC prior to any analysis. All the power calculations and methodology for data analysis have been confirmed by the trial statistician from the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU). Missing data: Every effort will be made to minimise missing baseline and outcome data in this trial. The level and pattern of the missing data in the baseline variables and outcomes will be established by forming appropriate tables and the likely causes of any missing data will be investigated. This information will be used to determine whether the level and type of missing data has the potential to introduce bias into the analysis results for the proposed statistical methods, or substantially reduce the precision of estimates related to treatment effects. If necessary, these issues will be dealt with using multiple imputation or Bayesian methods for missing data as appropriate. Sample size: The phase 1 trial will recruit up to 18 participants. Indicative sample size of 60 participants for the phase 2 clinical trial (30 in intervention arm), but will continue to recruit beyond this if there is no clear problem with safety, no clear results on clinical outcomes and the necessary resources are available. Although the primary focus of the phase 2 trial is safety, there is, however, power to detect a difference in physiological outcomes. The primary efficacy outcome measure will be the difference in oxygenation index (OI) between the ORBCEL-C and placebo treated groups at day 7. Based on our data from a recently completed clinical trial in ARDS, the mean (standard deviation; SD) OI at day 7 in patients with ARDS is 62(51)cmH2O/kPa [4]. To allow 1:1 recruitment (ORBCEL-C vs placebo) a sample size of 56 subjects will have 80% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 using a two-sample t-test to detect a clinically significant difference of 39 cmH2O/kPa in OI between groups. In a previous phase 2 study of similar size, we have found that an intervention can demonstrate a change in OI of a similar magnitude confirming a treatment effect of this size can be achieved [4]. Although we anticipate few withdrawals or loss to follow-up we have allowed for this in the sample size calculation. In previous UK multicentre studies in the critically ill <3% withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up [4, 65]. Therefore, a conservative drop-out rate of 5% has been estimated and the study will require a total of 60 patients (30 patients in the ORBCEL-C and 30 in the placebo group).",Phase 1/2

Because SARS-CoV-2 is known to require the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor for uptake into the human body, there have been questions about whether medications that upregulate ACE-2 receptors might increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications. One such group of medications are anti-hypertensives that block the renin-angiotensin system, including both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Both ACEi and ARB are widely used for the treatment of hypertension. Early reports from China and Italy suggest that many of those who die from COVID-19 have a coexisting history of hypertension. Consequently, there have been questions raised as to whether these 2 types of blood pressure medication might increase the risk of death among patients with COVID-19. However, it is well known that the prevalence of hypertension increases linearly with age. Therefore, it is possible that the high prevalence of hypertension and ACEi/ARB use among persons who die from COVID-19 is simply confounded by age (older people are at risk of both a history of hypertension and dying from COVID-19). Whether these commonly prescribed blood pressure medications increase the risk of COVID-19 or not remains unanswered. Statements from professional cardiology societies on both sides of the Atlantic have called for urgent research into this question. Our study aims to randomize patients with primary (essential) hypertension who are already taking ACEi/ARB to either switch to an alternative BP medication or continue with the ACEi/ARB that they have already been prescribed. Adults with compelling indications for ACEi/ARB will not be enrolled.",Phase 4

This infectious disease soon caused a large global outbreak and became a major public health issue.

In this particular time, only patients with SARS-CoV-2 or other diseases with an emergency condition were receipted by most of the hospitals in Hubei Province, even in many other regions of China. The delayed treatment for many chronic diseases, such as malignant tumors, is an increasing serious problem. One major concern was that patients with malignant tumors were generally older in age with low immunity. Preliminary study has shown that cancer patients are most susceptible to infect SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to develop a severe pneumonia. But many other researches suspected that conclusion. Moreover, many of the patients with malignant tumors are facing short term death from tumors rather than the risk of infection. Nevertheless, there is not sufficient evidence to insure the safety of chemotherapy in high-risk region of COVID-19, and there is also not sufficient information to judge which patients' tumor therapy can be appropriately delayed.

In-person visits to complete the psychological testing with the youth will be scheduled in the future when it is safe to meet face to face. ***  *** Detailed Description *** The proposed research plan is designed to develop and test the effectiveness of a national curriculum of the ASSIST (Advocating for SupportS to Improve Service Transition) program, a 12-week parent training program targeting parents' ability to advocate for services to improve the transition to adulthood for youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Preliminary work demonstrated that youth whose parents participated in the ""Volunteer Advocacy Program- Transition"" or VAP-T (a pilot 12-week intervention program on which ASSIST is based) were more likely to be employed or in postsecondary education (PSE), and received more school-based and adult services, when compared to a wait-list control group. In the proposed research, the investigators conduct a randomized-controlled trial with 180 families to build on previous findings in four important ways: 1) by making modifications to the program content to make it applicable to service systems across the nation, and rigorously testing whether the ASSIST program is effective when delivered across three states (Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin); 2) by incorporating the perspective of offspring with ASD into the intervention and data collection; 3) by examining mechanisms by which the ASSIST program influences youth outcomes; and 4) by exploring barriers to participation and factors that moderate treatment response. The investigators hypothesize that ASSIST participation will improve parents' advocacy ability, leading to higher rates of employment, PSE, social participation, and service access for youth with ASD. The investigators will test this hypothesis by randomly assigning parents of transition-aged youth with ASD (ages 16-26) to either a treatment or active, materials-only control group, and following families over 3 years. The investigators propose four Specific Aims: (1) To use a multi-site randomized-controlled trial to examine whether ASSIST participation increases parent advocacy ability (i.e. the intervention target); (2) To test whether participating in the ASSIST leads to improved youth outcomes (employment, post-secondary education, social participation, service access) during the transition to adulthood; (3) To examine which aspects of parent advocacy ability mediate the relations between ASSIST participation and youth outcomes; and (4) To explore moderators of treatment response and barriers to participation in the intervention. By rigorously testing a new intervention to improve the transition to adulthood for youth with ASD, the proposed research addresses an area of critical need as identified by the 2016-7 Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan. The project will result in a new intervention to improve outcomes for youth with ASD that can be disseminated through state and local agencies across the nation.",N/A

However, many Veterans cannot perform treadmill exercise because of lower extremity or other disabilities. For many years, pharmacologic myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has been the standard of care for their evaluation but fails to provide powerful prognostic and clinically relevant information of exercise testing, requires exposure to ionizing radiation, and is several times more expensive than exercise electrocardiography (ECG). With a recently completed Merit Review award, we obtained substantial retrospective observational evidence that arm exercise ECG stress testing scores are at least equivalent to pharmacologic MPI for robust prediction of mortality and other measures of clinical outcome in Veterans who cannot perform leg exercise. Major hypotheses for the current proposal are: 1) arm exercise ECG stress testing scores or best fit models without or with coronary artery calcium scoring (-/+ CACS) are non-inferior to the Duke Treadmill Score -/+ CACS, best fit model treadmill ECG and regadenoson (r) MPI stress testing, all performed in the same Veterans in randomized order, as an initial evaluation for obstructive coronary artery disease (oCAD), and 2) arm exercise ECG stress testing scores or best fit models -/+ CACS are non-inferior to the Duke Treadmill Score -/+ CACS, best fit model treadmill ECG and rMPI stress testing in the same Veterans for predicting the primary clinical endpoint (composite of cardiovascular (CV) mortality, myocardial infarction, or 90-day post-stress test coronary revascularization) and secondary clinical endpoints of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. Our specific aim for all Veterans referred to the St. Louis Veterans Administration (VA) stress testing laboratory and are without exclusions for exercise or regadenoson stress testing or cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CTA), is to perform a single site prospective clinical trial comparing arm exercise ECG stress test scores and best models -/+ CACS with the Duke Treadmill Score -/+ CACS if able to perform treadmill exercise, and best fit treadmill ECG and rMPI models, all performed in the same Veterans, for identification of the diagnostic endpoint of oCAD, defined as a severely ( 70%) occluded epicardial, graft, or 50% left main coronary artery lumen, determined by cardiac CTA or invasive coronary arteriography, and prediction of the primary and secondary clinical endpoints described above. The arm exercise scoring system to be evaluated incorporates the variables arm exercise capacity in resting metabolic equivalents, 1-minute heart rate recovery and arm exercise-induced ST depression of 1 mm or greater. Regadenoson MPI variables to be evaluated include an abnormal MPI study and best fit models of summed stress and difference scores, transient ischemic dilatation, gated left ventricular ejection fraction, and the heart rate response. We plan to enroll 75 Veterans per year for 4 years and follow the entire cohort for an additional year. Statistical analyses will be performed with SAS using univariate and multivariate logistic and Cox regression models. We will evaluate non-inferiority of arm exercise scores -/+ CACS for their association with oCAD and prediction of clinical endpoints with a non-inferiority margin of 0.05. A long term goal is to develop a multi-site prospective randomized VA Cooperative Study to assess generalizability of arm exercise ECG stress testing -/+ CACS for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in the VA and United States healthcare systems.",N/A

While researching for a vaccine has been started, effective therapeutic solutions are urgently needed to face this threaten. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a relevant role in COVID-19, as the virus will enter host 's cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); RAS disequilibrium might also play a key role in the modulation of the inflammatory response that characterizes the lung involvement. Angiotensin-(1-7) is a peptide that is downregulated in COVID-19 patient and it may potentially improve respiratory function in this setting. Methods/Design: The Investigators describe herein the methodology of a randomized, controlled, adaptive Phase II/Phase III trial to test the safety, efficacy and clinical impact of the infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. A first phase of the study, including a limited number of patients (n=20), will serve to confirm the safety of the study drug, by observing the number of the severe adverse events. In a second phase, the enrollment will continue to investigate the primary endpoint of the study (i.e. number of days where the patient is alive and not on mechanical ventilation up to day 28) to evaluate the efficacy and the clinical impact of this drug. Secondary outcomes will include the hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, ICU and hospital mortality, time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, reintubation rate, secondary infections, needs for vasopressors, PaO2/FiO2 changes, incidence of deep vein thrombosis, changes in inflammatory markers, angiotensins plasmatic levels and changes in radiological findings. The estimated sample size to demonstrate a reduction in the primary outcome from a median of 14 to 11 days is 56 patients, 60 including a dropout rate of 3% (i.e. 30 per group), but a preplanned recalculation of the study sample size is previewed after the enrollment of 30 patients. Expected outcomes/Discussion: This controlled trial will assess the efficacy, safety and clinical impact of the Angiotensin-(1-7) infusion in a cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The results of this trial may provide useful information for the management of this disease. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Rationale for the study The cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 can result in a functional reduction of ACE2 activity and this could lead to an increased activity of the Ang II/AT1 axis and decreased levels Ang-(1-7)/MasR expression that could contribute to the severity of the disease. The administration of Ang-(1-7) could reestablish this equilibrium, contributing to decrease pulmonary inflammation e thus decreasing the symptoms of the disease. Eligible patients and the next of kin (whenever possible) should be informed about the rationale and the aims of the study and potential risks of drug infusion. Local ethical regulations should be otherwise followed. Due to the eligibility criteria and the urgency setting, a delayed written consent may be obtained after randomization from the next of kin and/or the patient (i.e. after ICU discharge). Randomization will be performed using sealed envelopes with a ratio of 1:1 including information on treatment assignment and a five-digit number, which will be open by the person responsible for drug constitution. Each vial or syringe will be then labeled with the randomly allocated number it will be assigned to the nursing personnel. The doctors and nurses administering the drugs, as well as the local investigators and research personnel who collected data, were unaware of the treatment assignments. Randomization should occur within 24 hours since orotracheal intubation and drug infusion initiated within 4 hours from randomization. Trial will be conducted in adherence to the current Helsinki Declaration and the standard of good clinical practice. Screening of patients will only start after approval of the ethical committees (EC) in the trial sites. No deviation of the protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the ECs. Study Treatment Ang-(1-7) is a pre-constitute intravenous lyophilized formulation containing 0.5 mg/ ampoule and will be administered to patients via a dedicated central venous line at the initial dose of 0.1 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 2.5 mcg/Kg/day). After the first hour of infusion, if no decrease in mean arterial pressure (decrease superior to 30% or need to increase vasopressors ≥ 50% of an initial dosage to maintain a MAP ≥ 65mmHg), the infusion rate will be increased to 0.2 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 5 mcg/Kg/day). The infusion will be continued for up to 48 hours and then stopped. To this end, the substance solution, prepackaged, will be diluted in 1000ml of NaCl 0.9% and then infused using an infusion pump at corresponding speed. The placebo substance, made up of the vehicle alone, will also be intravenously administrated using the same procedure as that for the substance containing the active principle. Patient's management Management of any underlying comorbidity will be at discretion of the attending physicians; the use of international guidelines for the monitoring and the adequate therapeutic interventions are recommended in all patients. In particular, patients ventilation should be managed according to ATS/ESICM/SCCM 2017 consensus for the ventilation in ARDS patients which suggest low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 mL/Kg predicted body weight) associated with low plateau pressure (<30 cmH2O), high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) associated with recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning for periods longer than 12h in severe ARDS patients. Arterial gas analysis assessment should be performed at maximum intervals of six hours or more often according to the attending physician beliefs. Maintenance fluid should be chosen among balanced crystalloids and the quantity will be decided by the attending physician. Glucose management, nutrition protocols, decision to administer neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, ECMO, nitric oxide or any other adjunctive therapies will be continued according to center current clinical practice and will be recorded in the CRF file. Weaning procedure Regarding the weaning from mechanical ventilation, in order to standardize and reduce bias we will comply with the following procedures based on ARDS Network protocol (ARDSnet). Each day the patients enrolled will be assessed by the medical staff for the following weaning criteria: 1. FiO2 ≤ 0.40 and PEEP ≤ 8 cmH2O OR FiO2 < 0.50 and PEEP < 5 cmH2O 2. PEEP and FiO2 ≤ values of previous day. 3. No neuromuscular blocking agents 4. Patient has acceptable spontaneous breathing efforts (It will be allowed to decrease the respiratory rate on the ventilator up to 50% for 5 min to detect inspiratory effort) 5. Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg If all the above conditions will be met, medical staff will start a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) for up to 120 minutes using one of the following methods and maintaining a: FiO2 ≤ 0.5: 1. T-piece Tube 2. Pressure Support Ventilation ≤ 5 cmH2O with PEEP ≤ 5 cmH2O 3. CPAP with PEEP ≤ 5 cmH2O 4. Tracheal Collar mask To test the tolerance at such measures the medical staff will evaluate the following goals for a minimum of 30 minutes up to 120 minutes: 1. SpO2 ≥ 90% and / or PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg 2. Mean spontaneous tidal volume ≥ 4 ml/kg PBW (if measured) 3. Respiratory Rate ≤ 35 / min 4. pH ≥ 7.30 (if measured) 5. No respiratory distress (defined as 2 or more of the following): 1. Heart rate ≥ 120% of the rate (≤ 5 min at > 120% may be tolerated) 2. Marked use of accessory muscles 3. Abdominal paradox 4. Diaphoresis 5. Marked subjective dyspnea If all these goals will be met, the medical staff will consider extubation, otherwise the patient will be treated with the pre-weaning settings. Data Collection Data collection on admission will include: demographic characteristics, comorbidities, including use of antihypertensive medications, source of admission, primary and secondary diagnosis, delay since symptoms begin, APACHE II Score (the worst values within the first 24 hours), SOFA score on admission, Chest X-ray and Thoracic CT scan results if available, EKG trace, PaO2/FiO2 on admission. Daily data collection during ICU stay will include: continuous hemodynamic monitoring, including invasive arterial pressure monitoring and continuous EKG; SaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 every 2 hours; blood samples including Hb, glucose and several other chemical variables will be collected at least once per day at 8 am (or the first value of the day); ventilatory parameters and arterial gas analysis will be also collected every six hours; SOFA score; presence of any other documented infection (site, pathogen, treatment); presence of septic shock; daily diuresis and daily total fluid infusion, urine analysis including main electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium) and osmolarity every morning. The occurrence of serious adverse events (see specific paragraph in the text). Duration of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for tracheostomy. In case of death, reasons for withdrawal of care will be recorded. All the data will be recorded using the specific CRF forms, divided into a core section and a daily section and will be uploaded to a web-centralized protected database. Statistical Analysis First phase (Phase IIb) = 15 vs 15 patients Second phase (Phase III) = expected 30 vs 30 patients in total (recalculation of sample size after 15 vs. 15 patients included) The primary outcome of this study is the number of ventilator free days at day 28. Considering an expected median duration of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency patients of 14 days, to provide an absolute reduction of 22,5% with an alpha error of 0.05 and to provide a power to detect the effect of 80% and a dropout rate of 3%, 60 patients will need to be included in the primary analysis, 30 in each group. Pre-planned Stratified group analysis will be performed for the following group of patients: 1. History of hypertension vs. no history of hypertension 2. Treatment with ACEi, ARB or DRI drugs vs no treatment 3. Age (<65 vs. ≥ 65 years) 4. PaO2/FiO2 values at randomization (<100 vs ≥ 100) 5. Confirmed vs highly suspected COVID-19 Data Safety Management Members of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) are individuals free of conflicts of interest for this protocol; DSMC will analyze the safety of the study and their membership within the DSMC will be for the duration of this clinical trial. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded at the participating site on the specific CRF and their occurrence will be monitored by the DSMC at the different interim analysis. Formal meeting will be held for each interim analysis to review the data related to the primary outcome, the safety findings as well as the quality of the trial conduct. To enhance the integrity of the trial, the DSMC will have access to the different results aggregated by treatment group and remain unaware of the treatment assignment (the groups will be encoded as A and B). A report including data on recruitment and baseline characteristics and pooled data on eligibility violations will be prepared by the statistician for each DSMC meeting. Only the independent statistician will have access to the whole database. A closed report will be then prepared to allow confidential discussion of clinical data and the DSMC has to prepare minutes of their meetings, with a list of recommendations for the Steering Committee (to continue, to hold or to terminate the trial). If the recommendation is to stop the trial, a final decision will be made after the analysis of all patients included at the time (including patients randomized after data collection for the DSMC meeting). The Steering Committee will be responsible for deciding whether to continue, hold or stop the trial based on DSMC recommendations. The DSMC will be notified of all changes to the trial protocol or conduct. Organization Data will be recorded using pre-printed CRF by the attending physician or a trained research nurse. All data will be periodically introduced by trained personnel in the central web-based database. The study coordinator will contact each time a patient is included the local PI to ensure data collection and reporting as well as completion of patient follow-up or on premature termination of the study protocol.

NCT03388606,ClinicalTrials.gov,4/3/2020,12/1/2017,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03388606,All,Depression,,,Characterization and Treatment of Adolescent Depression,"Background: Almost 20% of Americans have depression. It is a leading cause of disability because it is chronic and it starts early. The highest incidence is among adolescents and young adults. But researchers don t know much about why some people become depressed whilst others don t. One possibility is that the way people process rewarding stimuli could be related to their risk for depression. Objective: To characterize and treat depression in youth by focusing on reward processing. Eligibility: People ages 11 17 with major depressive disorder or subthreshold depression Healthy volunteers ages 11 17 Design: Participants will be screened with interviews and questionnaires. They will have memory, thinking, and concentration tests. They may have a urine pregnancy test or have photos or videos taken. At the initial visit, participants will: Perform tasks and be interviewed Have functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. For this, participants will lie in a metal cylinder in a magnetic field. They will do study tasks while looking at a screen in the scanner. Look at pictures of stimuli that signal win (rewards) or loss and get money for making certain choices. Have brain and eye activity monitored Do tasks in a virtual reality environment Wear an activity monitor Choose to have blood taken for research studies Perform tasks while in magneto-encephalography a machine that uses sensitive magnetic sensors to measure the brain s electric activity Participants will get phone prompts at home to ask about their mood. Participants will have several follow-up visits the first year, then 1-2 each year until they are 25. They will repeat some tasks above. Some participants with depression can elect to receive outpatient treatment at NIH and can receive inpatient treatment at NIH, if they wish. None of the treatments are experimental, that is, all treatments are standard and have an evidence base. Patients will have more visits before and after they have treatment. They will do some of the tests above plus drug testing. Participants who are in treatment and their parents will talk with a Senior Attending physician, a nurse, social worker, or psychologist. Those in outpatient treatment will have practice work between visits. Those who are inpatients will have practice work during their inpatient treatment and adjustments to medication can be made. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Objective: Depression has a prevalence of 19% in the US population (Kessler & Bromet, 2013) and close to 350 million people suffer from the disorder worldwide (WHO, 2012). The chronic course of depression and its early onset-a maximal incidence in adolescence and young adulthood (Beesdo et al., 2009)-contribute to it being a leading cause of disability worldwide (WHO, 2014). Yet, compared to many other medical conditions, we know little about the mechanisms underlying depression. In recent years, reward processing have been proposed to underlie several key behavioral and neural aberrations observed in depression (Michael T Treadway & Zald, 2011;Whitton, Treadway, & Pizzagalli, 2015). This has led to the promise that targeting reward processing may lead to much needed breakthroughs in the field. In this protocol we seek to characterize and treat depression in youth by integrating methodological and conceptual approaches that specifically focus on reward processing. Patients and their families can elect to participate in standard outpatient or inpatient clinical care in this protocol. Our objective is to answer four key questions: 1. What is the concordance of measures of reward processing in depression over time? Measurement is fundamental to answering substantive questions in science. Our review of the literature identified gaps in the reliability of reward measurement, the concordance between measures, and a dearth of studies that employ repeated-measure designs. We propose to tackle this using a multi-method approach in a longitudinal design. 2. Are reward processing aberrations in depression similar to those in other common problems of childhood, such as anxiety and irritability? Specificity-in this case establishing which reward aberrations are unique to a certain phenotype as opposed to a generic finding related to psychopathology-is important for both nosology (disease classification) and for designing rational treatments for psychiatric problems. Below, we describe how we propose to answer this question by characterizing reward processing in those with depression and comparing it to processing in those with other common psychiatric problems in youth, such as anxiety and irritability. 3. How does reward processing interact with systems subserving sense of agency? As described above, decision-making is an intricate part of reward processing. It is assumed that higher-order cognitive processes, such as the sense of ownership of one s actions-referred to as sense of agency-influence reward processing. Establishing the role of such higher-order processes in depression could lead to developing treatments that boost cognition and restore reward processing in depression. Below, we propose to answer this question by testing whether inter-individual differences in sense of agency explain variation in depression via reward processing (a mediation model). 4. How is reward processing affected by changes in metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroendocrinological markers? There is mounting evidence for differences in metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroendocrine markers when comparing those with and without MDD; however, the relationship of such differences to reward processing-the focus of this protocol-remain poorly examined. We wish to explore the direction of effect between inflammatory responses and metabolic changes with depression and reward processes. We wish to do this informed by knowledge of an individual s genetic background. The aim is to establish trajectories of stability/change in metabolic and inflammatory markers and relate them to mood changes and reward changes over time. We also wish to align our protocol with Dr Zarate s Protocol 17-M-0060, Neuropharmacologic Imaging and Biomarker Assessments of Response to Acute and Repeated-Dosed Ketamine Infusions in Major Depressive Disorder that focuses on depression in adults. Collecting these data on adolescents will allow us to identify differences and overlaps between adolescents (from this protocol) and the adults in Dr. Zarate s protocol 17-M-0060. 5. How is reward processing affected by environmentally-generated stress? Studies from our own group demonstrate that stress in early life has an impact on how rewards and punishers are processed in the brain several years later (Vidal-Ribas et al 2019, Biol Psychiatry CNNI). Similarly, there is good evidence for the acute effects of stress on reward processing, as indicated in our recent metanalysis (Harreweijn et al 2020). And, of course, there is ample evidence for the role on how stressful events worsen symptoms of depression (Hettema et al 2006 Psychol Med; Kendler et al, Arch Gen Psych 2003; Kendler et al, AmJPsych 1999; Surtees et al, 1986). The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge for the world s physical health, but is also expected to have a profound impact on people s psychological wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge medical challenge to be sure, and, by virtue of being a naturally occurring stress, presents an opportunity for us, using longitudinal methods, to learn more about how humans respond to such environmental influences. Moreover, it offers an opportunity for us to understand more about human behaviour and potentially use such knowledge to inform future interventions. The aim, using remote on-line methods, is to learn about how such environmental stress is experienced by healthy volunteer teens and those with depression, the relationship between stress and self-rated measures of depression, and the association of measures of stress and depression on reward processing. Study population: We will study four populations: (1) Healthy volunteers (HVs; n=300); (2) Participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n=300); (3) Participants with subthreshold depression (s-MDD; n=200); (4) parents (biological or legal guardians) of children with MDD, s-MDD, or HVs who are enrolled in this protocol (N=800 total as 400/200/200 respectively). Study participants will be aged 11-1; years at the time of screening and initial enrollment in Characterization; this is a longitudinal study and participants who turn 18 may continue in it until they are 25. Design: This is a Characterization study hat includes longitudinal observation of three adolescent cohorts. HV, s-MDD and MDD subjects will be take part in a longitudinal,observational study that involves clinical assessment, computer tasks, blood for inflammatory and neuroendocrinological markers, fMRI and MEG scanning and continue to return until they reach age 25 years. Adolescent patients who still suffer from MDD will be offered outpatient clinical care in the form ofopen-label Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; up to 26 weeks). During and following outpatient clinical care, participants with MDD will continue in Characterization. Upon completion of clinical care patients will return to care in the community. MDD patients who are clinically unstable and are eligible for standard clinical treatment as inpatients or day-patients and may enter treatment at NIH. They may do this after starting in Characterization or at their initial enrollment.

The symptoms can be extremely varied and the course can range from spontaneous healing without sequelae to death. Currently, the diagnosis of certainty for resuscitation patients (by definition ""severe"") is based on searching for a fragment of virus genetic material within the epithelial cells of the respiratory tree, up and/or down, by PCR. It is to be expected that the epidemic peak will make it difficult (if not impossible) to respect the stereotypical path that is currently in place, due to the lack of space in the specific unit. This will require optimization of care pathways and use of the specific sectors. It is therefore necessary to define the simple criteria, available from the moment patients are admitted, to predict the result of the COVID-19 PCR.",

The virus causing pneumonia was then identified as a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Since this time, the infection called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world, causing huge stress for health care systems. To diagnose this infection, throat and nose swabs are taken. Unfortunately, the results often take more than 24 hrs to return from a laboratory. Speeding diagnosis up would be of great help. This study aims to look at the breath to find signs that might allow clinicians to diagnose the coronavirus infection at the bedside, without needing to send samples to the laboratory. To do this, the team will be using a machine called a BreathSpec which has been adapted to fit in the hospital for this purpose. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is of increasing interest in the diagnosis of lung infection. Over 2,000 VOCs can be detected through gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS); patterns of VOC detected can offer information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer and interstitial lung disease. Unfortunately, GC-MS while highly sensitive cannot be done at the bedside and at best takes hours to prepare samples, run the analysis and then interpret the results. Compared with other methods of breath analysis, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) offers a tenfold higher detection rate of VOCs. By coupling an ion mobility spectrometer with a GC column, GC-IMS offers immediate twofold separation of VOCs with visualisation in a three-dimensional chromatogram. The total analysis time is about 300 seconds and the equipment has been miniaturised to allow bedside analysis. The BreathSpec machine has been previously used to study both radiation injury in patients undergoing radiotherapy at the Edinburgh Cancer Centre (REC ref 16-SS-0059, as part of the H2020 TOXI-triage project, http://www.toxi-triage.eu/) and pneumonia in patients presenting to the ED of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (REC ref 18-LO-1029). This work has developed artificial intelligence methodology that allows rapid analysis of the vast amount of data collected from these breath samples to identify signatures that may indicate a particular pathological process such as pneumonia or radiation injury. The TOXI-triage project showed that the BreathSpec GC-IMS could rapidly triage individuals to identify those who had been exposed to particular volatile liquids in a mass casualty situation (http://www.toxi-triage.eu/). A pilot trial assessed chest infections at the Acute Medical Unit of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. The final diagnostic model permitted fair discrimination between bacterial chest infections and chest infections due to other agents with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.86). The summary test characteristics were a sensitivity of 62% (95% CI 41-80%) and specificity of 80% (95% CI 64 - 91%) [8]. This was expanded in the EU H2020 funded ""Breathspec Study"" which aimed to differentiate breath samples from patients with bacterial or viral upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Over 1220 patients were recruited, with 191 patients identified as definitely bacterial infection and 671 classed as definitely not bacterial. Virology was undertaken on all patients, with 259 patients confirmed viral infection. Date processing is still on going to determine how well they can be distinguished using this methodology. More than 100 patients were recruited to this study in Edinburgh. Since then, artificial intelligence has been incorporated into our analytical processes, permitting faster and more refined analysis. Our ambition is that this technology will identify a signature of Covid-19 pneumonia or within 10 min in non-invasively collected breath samples to allow triage of patients into high and low risk categories for Covid-19. This will allow targeting of scarce resources and complex protocols associated with high risk patients including personal protective equipment (PPE), cohorting, and dedicated medical and nursing personel.",

Preliminary findings indicate that they may be atypical. There is a need to identify the spectrum of clinical presentations, predictors of severe disease (COVID-19) outcomes, and successful treatment strategies in this population. Goals: Primary - Describe and compare characteristics of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected children with symptomatic test-negative children. Secondary - 1) Describe and compare confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected children with mild versus severe COVID-19 outcomes; 2) Describe healthcare resource utilization for, and outcomes of, screening and care of pediatric COVID-19 internationally, alongside regional public health policy changes. Methods: This prospective observational study will occur in 50 emergency departments across 11 countries. We will enroll 12,500 children who meet institutional screening guidelines and undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing. Data collection focuses on epidemiological risk factors, demographics, signs, symptoms, interventions, laboratory testing, imaging, and outcomes. Collection will occur at enrollment, 14 days, and 90 days. Timeline: Recruitment will last for 12 months (worst-case model) and will begin within 7-14 days of funding notification after ongoing expedited review of ethics and data sharing agreements. Impact: Results will be shared in real-time with key policymakers, enabling rapid evidence-based adaptations to pediatric case screening and management. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Pediatric COVID-19: The characteristics of pediatric 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are not yet well understood. Preliminary findings indicate that atypical presentations of COVID-19 occur in children. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify risk factors for pediatric COVID-19 infection, the range of clinical manifestations, predictors of severe outcomes, and successful treatment strategies. Objectives: Primary: To contribute to the optimization of medical countermeasures to pediatric COVID-19 through describing and comparing the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected children (i.e. test positive) with children who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 but tested negative. We will also describe and compare SARS-CoV-2 infected children with mild versus those with severe outcomes. This study will also describe the health care resources utilized for screening, isolation, and care of pediatric COVID-19, examined alongside relevant public health policies. Methods: This is a two-year prospective observational study that will take place at 50 EDs across 19 countries. We will enroll children (<18 years old) presenting to participating study EDs who meet institutional screening guidelines and undergo testing for COVID-19. Data collection is aligned with WHO templates and focuses on epidemiological factors, demographics, signs, symptoms, exposures, interventions, and test results. Collection will occur at the time of enrolment, during the course of illness, at hospital discharge (if admitted), and at two weeks and three months following enrolment. Over a period of 18 months (starting March 31st, 2020) we aim to enroll and complete follow-up for a total of 5000 children with screened for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data will be entered into a centralized database, and analyzed using simple and multiple ordinal logistic regression models. Data will be interpreted alongside detailed, prospectively collected, information on the changes to case isolation, screening, and management policies that occur throughout the epidemic in each institution and study region. Feasibility: The Pediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) represents the largest international acute pediatric care collaboration in the world, including more than 200 hospitals across 35 countries. Currently, PERN is carrying out the PERN-Pneumonia prospective cohort study, designed to identify predictors of severe pneumonia at 70 hospitals around the globe, including at eight Canadian pediatric emergency departments (ED). This study will build onto the PERN-Pneumonia study infrastructure (e.g. ethics approvals, data sharing agreements, research teams) in order to facilitate a unique, rapid, and global response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Feasibility is enhanced by our design - we will not interfere with the existing COVID-19 screening and management procedures in-place in study EDs; we will not collect any biological specimens, and will not prescribe any interventions. Project Team: This international multidisciplinary team includes pediatric emergency medicine and infectious disease clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and public health leaders from around the globe. Team members have led many landmark trials in pediatric emergency medicine, and lead large pediatric research networks and studies including the PERN-Pneumonia study. They also came together to study the H1N1 pandemic and identified predictors of severe outcomes. Team members also have expertise in pediatric lower respiratory tract infections, biostatistics, and epidemiology (including the CDC lead on the MERS-CoV outbreak). This study team also includes the Public Health Agency of Canada's senior medical/technical expert on COVID-19. Impact of the research: The results of this study, which will be shared in real-time with appropriate national and international authorities, will enable policymakers to make rapid evidence-based adaptations to case screening and management procedures that will then allow for the earlier identification of children likely to have confirmed infection with COVID-19 as well as to prioritize those children likely to have severe outcomes. Finally, the establishment of this global multi-site study will be the first trial of a rapid PERN networks response to a pandemic novel respiratory virus, which, applying lessons-learned, can be urgently reactivated for future public health emergencies.",

Descriptive reports of the collected data will be produced regularly. Different levels of aggregation will be considered: single center, province, region. In addition to providing useful elements to describe the evolution of the epidemic, the results presented in these reports will provide an accurate clinical description of a large sample of COVID-19 patients. The study data will be leveraged to identify the most important risk factors and clinical conditions to predict poor patient outcomes. The most relevant factors will be selected using state-of-the-art techniques. These factors will be used as predictors in multivariable predictive models, which will be developed to estimate the expected prognosis of the patients. The study outcomes will be death or need of intubation within 7 days since ED arrival and 30-day mortality. Given the dichotomous nature of these variables, the models will be developed with logistic regression. The models will be first developed when the study will enroll the minimum number of necessary patients, and periodically updated. In this way, predictive tools capable of making accurate estimates of the prognosis of patients will be returned to the clinical practice as soon as possible. The study will record the use of treatments and drugs, such as antivirals, ACE inhibitors and sartans, whose effect on COVID-19 patients is not yet clear and mostly based on small studies. The large cohort of patients will be used to perform CER analyses and evaluate the effect of these treatments on the prognosis of patients, with appropriate statistical methodology to account for the observational nature of the data. These results will be used to refine and improve the experimental design of this project.",

We will include patients regardless of time since symptom onset. In addition, we will include asymptomatic patients with comorbidities including cardiac, pulmonary, diabetes, chronic renal failure or liver disease (definitions in Appendix 1) hospitalized for observation. - Informed consent from patient or legal representative Exclusion criteria: - Severe infection, defined as need for invasive or non-invasive ventilator support, ECMO or shock requiring vasopressor support. - Unable to take oral medication - Known allergy to HCQ or chloroquine - Prolonged QT, defined as QTc ≥450 milliseconds for men and as QTc ≥470 for women - Severely reduced LV function (Ejection fraction<30%) - Retinopathy - Pregnancy or breast feeding - Concomitant treatment with azithromycin, flecainide, amiodarone, digoxin, procainamide, propafenone, thioridazine, pimozide. - Chronic chloroquine/ HCQ treatment (within 1 month) - Need for hemodialysis - Participating in another RCT for treatment of COVID-19 Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ration. Randomization will be done using a computer-generated list of random numbers allocated centrally through a web site, stratified by hospital. The random sequence will include random permuted blocks of 4 The intervention group will receive oral hydroxychloroquine. In the first day 400 mg twice daily, followed by 200mg twice daily on days 2-10 (continued after discharge if discharged before day 10). The control group will not receive hydroxychloroquine. Physicians will be allowed to provide other medications at their discretion. For patients in the control group who develop severe disease (as defined), the physician will be allowed to use HCQ. Criteria for discontinuing study drug include development of any of the following: - Serious adverse event related to the drug (QT prolongation, anaphylaxis reaction) - Participant request Primary outcome: Number of patients developing severe infection (as defined above at the section of exclusion criteria) or death within 28 days. Secondary outcomes: - Number of patients with severe disease as defined above - All-cause mortality within 30 days - Time to symptom resolution defined as days until normalization of fever (37.9ºC), respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and alleviation of cough, sustained for at least 72 hours. - Duration (days) of mechanical ventilation - Clinical status at day 5 as assessed by National Early Warning Score 2 - Virological failure, defined as positive PCR from respiratory or other body sample at day 5. - Development of acute myocarditis defined as symptoms of heart failure, chest pain or arrhythmia, in the presence of elevated serum Troponin or reduced ejection fraction by echocardiography, and no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. - Antibacterial consumption, measured as days of therapy (DOT) - Number of adverse events - prolonged QT, arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting (severe) - Time to hospital discharge. - Discharge to LTCF, rehabilitation (for patients admitted from home) The trial will test for chloroquine's superiority (1-sided alpha) assuming a primary outcome incidence of 10% in the control group and a reduction of 30% in the intervention group. With a 1-sided 5% alpha a fixed sample of 558 patients per group will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between study groups (PS power and sample size). However, the trial will use an adaptive approach to determine the final sample size. Interim analyses for the primary outcome will be conducted by statisticians with expertise in adaptive design. Patients will be follow-up daily in-hospital. Vital and respiratory signs and symptoms will be captured daily. Electrocardiogram will be performed on day 3 for all patients, with follow-up as required. Adverse effects will be monitored daily and documented, including gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash or other skin manifestations. If antibiotic treatment will be needed, we will refrain from using azithromycin. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine levels, CPK and liver enzymes (including LDH) will be obtained at recruitment if unavailable from the last 24 hours. Blood count, electrolytes and creatinine levels will be repeated on days 5+/-2. Other tests will be performed as clinically indicated. Chest x-ray or other chest imaging will be performed at recruitment if not performed previously and repeated as necessary according to clinical judgment. PCR from respiratory or body samples will be obtained on day 5 (or discharge if prior to day 5) and otherwise as clinically indicated. Blood samples for serology will be taken at recruitment and at day 14 (or at discharge if before day 14). Samples will be frozen and batch analyzed at the end of the study. Patients will not be contacted after discharge, assuming no change in status after discharge (carry-forward assumption). Survival at day 30 will be ascertained using the health ministry records. The data will be entered anonymously into a central case report form (CRF) designed in RedCap. We will document the follow-up, patients' medical treatment, including antiviral, antimicrobial and supportive care and all adverse events. Trial follow-up and monitoring will be performed by The Rambam-Technion ID research using a risk-based monitoring approach with adaptive on-site monitoring. Trial flow and recruitment follow-up: Recruitment reports will be collected monthly, detailing the number of eligible patients, excluded patients, reason for exclusion and number of included patients, in a structured table. The recruitment status vs. expected recruitment rate will be reported monthly, overall and per site. Remote monitoring will be performed continuously throughout the trial to check for data completion and quality. Critical variables will be defined, based on data needed for baseline description of the study cohort, information regarding the intervention and outcome data. Feedback will be provided to local study coordinators via email or telephone. Data will be completed or corrected in real time with the support of the monitoring center. Risk thresholds will be defined for onsite monitoring. Onsite monitoring will be performed periodically and as required following the remote monitoring thresholds. The regular onsite monitoring visits will include: - Inspection of the informed consent forms with dates corresponding to recruitment - Inclusion criteria confirmed vs. patients' charts - Confirmation of primary outcome data in source documents The trial will be followed by an independent data and safety monitoring board and a steering committee. No interim analyses are planned. All serious adverse events will be reported to the independent monitoring board. Interim analyses and serious adverse events will be reported to the local ethics committees, as per local good practice guidelines. The primary analysis will include all randomized patients by intention to treat. A per-protocol analysis will include patients who received the allocated intervention for at least 5 calendar days. Patients' baseline characteristics will be reported as mean with standard deviation, or median with interquartile based on variable distributions. The relative risk for the primary outcome will be computed with 95% confidence intervals. Time dependent variables will be analyzed using Kaplan Meyer curves. The trial will not be powered for subgroup analyses. The study will be approved by the local ethics committees in participating hospitals. Informed consent will be required for participation from the patients or their legal guardians. Owing to severe isolation precautions, a modification to the informed consent process is required. The investigators will present the study drug and related information to the subjects through a phone call. Subjects who agree to participate will sign an informed consent form which will be documented via a video chat. The informed consent process and form will be reviewed by the IRB in order to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable. This study is not funded.",Phase 1

It has manifest into a global health crisis with escalating confirmed cases and spread across 15 countries. Whilst it is currently an epidemic in China, The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Level risk assessment is set at high 2. Sequencing showed that 2019-nCov is similar to bat severe acute syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats 3. This is compatible with the initial epidemiological link with a local wet market which sells bats. Furthermore, data sharing and sequencing data has facilitated development of accurate diagnostic tests. In contrast, our current understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of 2019-nCov is limited. In a case series of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed infection, at least 30% of these patients required critical care admission. These patients developed severe respiratory failure and 10% required mechanical ventilation and 5% needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. More worryingly 2019-nCov infection was associated with 15% mortality. Although these figures are likely overestimates due to unreported mild cases, there is currently no effective treatment. The optimal supportive care for patients with severe 2019-nCov infection is a research priority. The spread of the 2019-nCov epidemic to Hong Kong has started. Patients have been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for multiorgan dysfunction. Currently there are no published data focused specifically on critically ill patients with nCov infection.

Specific objectives: - To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MxA for viral CAP (sub-study I) - To study etiologies in children with CAP (sub-study II) - To evaluate sensitivity and specificity for MariPOC® Respi test versus PCR for detection of respiratory viruses (sub-study III) - To assess sensitivity and specificity for a novel RPA-based point-of-care test versus PCR for detection of respiratory viruses (sub-study IV) - To assess long-term complications in children with CAP (sub-study V The study takes place at Sachs' Children and Youth hospital in Stockholm. ***  *** Detailed Description *** Background: Respiratory viral and bacterial infections are hard to distinguish clinically, and many children with viral infections receive unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, which contributes to development and spread of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is a need for new point-of-care diagnostic tests that better distinguish viral from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections, particularly in children presenting with suspected clinical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and thus assist health-care workers decision making and improve rational use of antibiotics. Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) is a promising biomarker for viral infection, but no studies have investigated MxA in children with CAP. Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as a biomarker for severe bacterial infection as the protein rapidly increases in plasma levels in response to stress and systemic infection. PCT has been reported to be more specific for bacterial infection as compared to CRP, but there are conflicting data on the clinical utility of PCT in children with CAP. The role of viruses and atypical bacteria in childhood CAP Is increasingly recognized. Recent studies have reported an increasing incidence of B. pertussis and there have been several deaths in previously healthy infants associated with whooping cough in Sweden over the last ten years. Consequently, there is a need for new etiologic studies in childhood CAP. Real-time PCR is currently considered gold-standard for detection of respiratory viruses in children with respiratory tract infection. Nevertheless, the turn-around time is usually long and the test results can rarely be used for decision making regarding treatment. There are currently several new antigen-based point-of-care tests of respiratory infections on the market, one is Multianalyte Point-of-care Antigen Detection Test System (MariPOC®) Respi. The sensitivity for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus is as high as 90% as compared to PCR, the current gold-standard PCR, but, the sensitivity for less common respiratory viruses such as metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus and bocavirus have been insufficiently investigated. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a nucleic acid amplification method that doesn't require thermal cycling. As the test reaction can be carried out at room temperature it is a particularly interesting method for resource-limited settings where the need for new diagnostic tests is high. Studies on long-term outcomes of radiologically confirmed bacterial CAP have indicated that the disease is associated with later development of asthma and decreased lung-function. Given the ongoing change in etiology of pediatric CAP, there is a need for new studies of long-term complications in pediatric CAP. Overall Aim: The overall aim of the TREND study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiology in children below 5 years of age with clinical CAP. Specific objectives: - To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MxA for viral CAP (sub-study I) - To study etiologies in children with CAP (sub-study II) - To evaluate sensitivity and specificity for MariPOC® Respi test versus PCR for detection of respiratory viruses (sub-study III) - To assess sensitivity and specificity for a novel RPA-based point-of-care test versus PCR for detection of respiratory viruses (sub-study IV) - To assess long-term complications in children with CAP (sub-study V) Study Design: The TREND study is a hospital-based prospective observational study of children with clinical CAP with asymptomatic controls at the emergency department at Sachs' Children and Youth hospital, Stockholm. Case definition Children 1-59 months with clinical CAP according to WHO-criteria. Bronchodilator challenge: Inhalation with a rapid acting bronchodilator will be administered to children with wheezing and in-drawings to improve the specificity of the WHO clinical CAP criteria as suggested by the PERCH study team. Resolved in-drawings after bronchodilator challenge will be recorded but not considered an exclusion criteria to be able to exclude these patients in a sub-analysis. Control definition: Children 1-59 months at Sachs' Children and Youth Hospital treated for a minor orthopedic or minor surgical disease. The parents to the controls will be contacted via email/telephone 1-2 weeks after enrollment and be asked whether the child has developed respiratory symptoms or not. No matching will be performed but adjustments for age and season will be performed in the analyses. Sampling: A capillary blood sample and nasopharyngeal swabs/aspirates will be collected from all study subjects. Microbiological and Biochemistry Analyses: MariPOC® Respi as well as real-time PCR analysis (detecting: 16 respiratory viruses as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) will be performed. Biochemistry Analyses: Serum MxA, procalcitonin and CRP levels will be analysed. Study Variables: Information regarding the study subject, number of siblings, days of illness, current symptoms, vaccinations, antibiotic treatment, medication, underlying diseases, heredity for asthma, previous hospitalization, recent stay abroad, allergies, smoking, recent travel abroad, recent contact with unwell individual, breastfeeding, preschool, origin of parents and socio-economic status will be collected through a standardized questionnaire based on previous studies. Clinical parameters will be registered by the study doctor responsible for patient screening/enrolment in line with the study protocol of PERCH. Some of the clinical parameters included in the PERCH protocol are very rare in a Swedish context and to avoid overloading of the case report form, these will not be systematically registered at inclusion. However, information about these symptoms will be retrospectively collected from the medical records. Some clinical parameters are routinely recorded multiple times at the emergency unit. In these cases, the most extreme value (highest pulse/respiratory rate/body temperature/etc and lowest peripheral oxygen saturation) during the visit at the emergency unit until enrolment will be recorded. Information regarding admission, length of stay, radiological, routine clinical examination, microbiological and chemistry analyses, treatment, discharge diagnosis and complications will be retrospectively collected from the medical records. All study subjects will be linked to the National Vaccination register to collect information regarding previous immunizations. To allow assessment of long-term complication, study subjects will also be linked to the National Patient Register, the National Death Register and the National Prescribed Drug Register for collection of discharge diagnoses according to ICD-10 as well as prescribed drugs. Classification of Disease: Etiology will be classified as probable or definitive based on clinical significance of the different microbiological test in the studies above. In TREND, the combination of probable and definitive etiology will be used in the main analysis, whereas children with definitive etiology will be assessed separately in a sub-analysis. Definitive Viral Infection: • PCR positive for influenza, RS virus, metapneumovirus or parainfluenza virus Probable Viral Infection: - PCR positive for adenovirus - PCR positive for coronavirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus or enterovirus AND CRP <20 AND reported fever >24h. Definitive Bacterial Infection: - positive bacterial blood culture in blood or pleura fluid - positive pneumococcal antigen test in pleura fluid Probable Bacterial Infection: - CRP >80 (children ≤2 years) / >120 (children 2-5 years) AND/OR - Radiographic evidence of empyema on X-ray or ultrasound AND/OR - Large dense infiltrate or lobar consolidation on chest x-ray Definitive Atypical Bacterial Infection: • Positive PCR B. pertussis or B. parapertussis Probable Atypical Bacterial Infection: • Positive PCR M. pneumoniae Undetermined: • Cases not fulfilling any criteria above Mixed Viral-bacterial Infection: • Children fulfilling criteria for both viral and bacterial infection Classification of Long-term Complications: Long-term complications (asthma and number of hospital-requiring respiratory infections) will be assessed after 3, 7 and 10 years following study completion by linking to the National Patient Register. Asthma will be classified as ICD-10 diagnosis of J45 or ≥3 prescriptions of inhalation steroids, beta-2-agonists or leukotriene antagonists according to the Prescribed Drug Register. Power Calculation: For the sample size calculation, the investigators focused on the assessment of MxA-levels in cases with viral CAP as compared to cases with bacterial CAP/controls (study I). Two power calculations were made, one for viral CAP versus bacterial CAP and one for viral CAP versus controls. The following assumptions were made: A difference in MxA-level of 500µg/l between the groups was considered clinically relevant. A standard deviation of 1000 and 300 was assumed in cases with viral CAP and bacterial CAP/controls respectively based on previous studies on MxA. Using an alpha-level of 0.05 (two-sided) at an 80% power, with an additional 20% addition to account for non-parametric testing and multivariate analyses, 42 children in each group (viral CAP, bacterial CAP and controls) would be needed. To ensure that enough of the included cases would fulfill the TREND definition of viral and bacterial CAP, the proportion of viral respectively bacterial CAP (TREND definition) was calculated in our previous study that assessed Swedish children with x-ray verified CAP. By doing this, the prevalence of viral and bacterial CAP was estimated to 45% and 14% respectively. Hence 300 cases and 42 controls would be needed to ensure sufficient collection of cases with viral and bacterial CAP respectively. The investigators also would like to compare cases with viral CAP with controls testing positive for one or more virus by PCR. In our previous study, 35.4% of asymptomatic children tested positive for one or more virus. To include a sufficient number of virus-positive controls, the investigators hence aim at including 300 cases and 119 controls (42/0.354=119) in the TREND-study. Ethical Considerations: The study will be conducted in accordance with the latest version of The Declaration of Helsinki and the fundamental principles of respect for the individual (Article 8), their right to self-determination and the right to make informed decisions (Articles 20, 21 and 22) regarding participation in research, both initially and during the course of the research. Significance: The findings from the TREND project can be an important step to improve the care of children with clinical CAP. Improved near-patient differential diagnosis is a prerequisite for rational antibiotic use and decreasing unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Further better diagnosis of the pathogens causing acute respiratory infections makes it easier to give advice to parents on how their children should be cared for and better surveillance in the society.",
